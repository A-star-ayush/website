<p>After the exciting news of the Alpha 1 release, another bit of good news poured in. Colin GÃ¼nther has been working on creating a Haiku WIFI stack for the <a href="http://www.haikuware.com/wireless-network-stack-bounty" title="WIFI bounty">WIFI bounty</a> over at Haikuware. The stack, which he is creating as a part of his MSc Thesis, is currently a port of the FreeBSD 8.0 WLAN Stack. His further plans are described in his <a href="http://www.haikuware.com/blog/colin/" title="Colin's blog">blog</a>, where he writes about his progress.</p>

<p>Yesterday, he <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-development/WLAN-stack-Call-for-testers" title="announced">announced</a> that the stack is ready for testing. One caveat: only the atheros driver is completed for unsecured networks. If you own such a wireless card, head on over to <a href="http://dev.osdrawer.net/news/show/32" title="the call for testers">the call for testers</a> on the <a href="http://dev.osdrawer.net/wiki/haiku-wifi" title="Wi-Fi wiki">Wi-Fi wiki</a>. The atheros driver should cover most netbooks; <a href="http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base/stable/8/share/man/man4/ath_hal.4?view=markup" title="here">here</a> is a list of the supported devices. Colin left the following notes for those interested in testing:</p>

<p>What to expect of the WLAN-Stack:</p>

<ul>
 <li>auto connect to an unsecured (open) WLAN</li>
 <li>wlan device will appear as an ethernet card</li>
 <li>full support of Haiku's network configuration utilities (Network preflet, ifconfig)</li>
 <li>no WLAN specific configuration utility (neither GUI, nor CLI)</li>
 <li>no listing of available WLANs</li>
</ul>
