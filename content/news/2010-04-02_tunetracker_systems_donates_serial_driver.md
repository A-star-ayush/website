A newly-developed hardware driver will allow Haiku to access multiple serial ports via a PCI serial card. The new "pc_serial" driver was commissioned by <a href="http://www.tunetrackersystems.com" title="TuneTracker Systems website">TuneTracker Systems</a> and is being donated to the Haiku user community.

The driver, coded by Fran√ßois "mmu_man" Revol, is known to work well with the widely-available Manhattan brand of serial cards, and increases to three the number of serial ports available on the average system (including the built-in serial port found on many motherboards.)   

The code for the driver has already been committed to the SVN repository and is expected to be added to the build images in the near future.
