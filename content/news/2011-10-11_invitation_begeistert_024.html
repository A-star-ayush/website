<p>We'd like to invite everyone to <a href="http://www.haiku-support-association.org/index-eng.html">HSA's</a> 24th BeGeistert, the largest Haiku conference around. On the weekend of October 29th/30th developers and users meet again in <a href="http://www.jugendherberge.de/jh/rheinland/duesseldorf/index.shtml.en?m">Düsseldorf's Youth Hostel</a> to code and talk and see what's new in the Haiku world. A perfect opportunity to learn of others' projects or present your own.<br />
Currently we plan to have these talks and workshops on the agenda:</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
<li><p>Ingo Weinhold demonstrates the state of our package management.</p></li>
<li><p>Oliver Tappe leads the way from SVN to GIT for Haiku's source control.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael Lotz regales us with an account of the first weeks of his half-year Haiku contract and what's planned for the immediate future.</p></li>
<li><p>Stephan Aßmus reveals the in and out of layout management (<s>if he makes it to BeGeistert</s> He'll be there. Yay!).</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Stiehler shows off his project Voptop.</p></li>
<li><p>Matt Madia reports of his work for Haiku Inc.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides these talks and workshops we'll have a "patch hour" where everyone tries to get as many patches from our bugtracker committed to the Haiku trunk as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the weekend there'll again be a week-long Code Sprint where a bunch of Haiku developers do some marathon programming. Sitting in one room helps tremendously when tackling tough problems together. Join them to find out for yourself!</p>
<p>Registration is now possible and highly recommended to make sure you find a place in the youth hostel.<br />
<div class="alert alert-warning">For technical reasons, if you registered before the middle of September and never received and replied to a confirmation mail, you'll have to register again. Sorry about that...</p></div>

We hope many Haiku fans can make it to BeGeistert 024 and celebrate with us the 10th year of Haiku development!</p>
<p>Your BeGeistert team</p>
