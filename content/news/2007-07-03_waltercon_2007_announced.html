                    <p>The upcoming Haiku conference WalterCon 2007 has finally been announced: this year, it will be held in San Francisco, California, on August 11 and 12.</p>
<p>As last year, we've prepared a <a href="http://waltercon.haiku-os.org/" rel="nofollow">website</a> that hopefully contains all the information you need to decide whether or not you want to attend. The conference will feature training-oriented sessions, though the agenda has not been completed yet. Take your chance to get to know some of the people behind Haiku!</p>
