Miroslav Stimac, a part time student at the FernUniversitaet in Hagen, is writing a master thesis about Haiku and asks you to answer his survey at <a href="http://www.haiku-survey.com/">www.haiku-survey.com</a>. The survey is relatively short, and should be answered in about two minutes.

The aggregated results of the survey are expected to be published in early 2011, so don't hold your breath.
