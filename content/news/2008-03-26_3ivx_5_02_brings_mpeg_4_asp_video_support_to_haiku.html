Ltd" class="image img_assist_custom" width="308" height="102"></span>David McPaul, on behalf of 3ivx Technologies Pty. Ltd, has just announced <a href="http://www.freelists.org/archives/openbeos/03-2008/msg00103.html">on the Haiku mailing list</a> the release of the latest version (5.02) of the 3ivx MPEG-4 ASP video decoder and encoder for the BeOS R5 platform, including
an experimental 3ivx decoder for Haiku. Available <a href="http://www.3ivx.com/">on the 3ivx website</a>, this release includes many bug fixes, frame accurate seeking, experimental support for mp4 files and aac audio, and a Haiku version of the 3ivx decoder. Haiku versions of the 3ivx decoder and aac decoder are expected to be supported in the future, and a Haiku-specific 3ivx encoder will be released once encoding support is added to the Haiku Media Kit. This is an exciting development, and hopefully just the beginning of a bright future for Haiku in the area of media format support.</p>        </div>
