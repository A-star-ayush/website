<p>To all the Haiku fans out there who have been eagerly looking forward to getting their hands on the first official Haiku CD, the wait is finally over: Haiku R1/Alpha 1 CDs are now available on the Haiku Store! Since a lot of sweat and tears have gone into this first Haiku release, we wanted the availability of our first official CD to also be an opportunity for the community to give something back to the project. To that effect, we have priced it as a commemorative CD which, for every unit you purchase, $15 will go into the project coffers. Thus, not only do you get a nicely branded Haiku CD, but you also help fund the future development of Haiku.</p>
