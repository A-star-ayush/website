Announcing development contracts is one of the best feelings.
It is a time when a volunteer developer is given the opportunity 
to dedicate a large block of time for their hobby -- developing HAIKU!
This is made possible through the countless donations from people like you,
who love Haiku and are willing to give what is right for them, to make Haiku a better
operating system. Thank you to all of 
<a href="http://www.haiku-inc.org/public-sponsors.html">our supporters, both public and anonymous</a>!
</p>
<p>
This time, we are pleased to announce that <strong>Alexandre Deckner will be working
on the WebKit port and, if time allows, WebPositive</strong>. You may remember "aldeck"
primarily from his work on Tracker -- squashing bugs, rewriting sections for better 
performance and updating it to <a href="https://github.com/aldeck/haiku/tree/tracker_layout">utilize the Layout API</a>. 
As Alexandre states, <i>
	"Good web support is something crucial for any operating system these days, 
	it is for some users the main software they will use on a computer and one 
	of the first things a new user will try on Haiku. To summarize, Haiku has 
	to provide the best web experience possible and i believe i can help to go
	in that direction."</i>
