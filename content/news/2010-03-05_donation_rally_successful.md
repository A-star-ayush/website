It's not just Stippi's project that's a huge success (see the WebKit/Web+ progress documented in his <a href="/blog/stippi"> blog posts</a>). Our call for donations for this kind of contractual work is also doing very well!
In the two weeks since our announcement to hire developers for specific projects, donations have picked up significantly. Since then we received over $1,600USD and a few more people opting for small but recurrent monthly funding.

Our thanks go out to all contributors! This shows that our Haiku community is strong and effective when called upon!
