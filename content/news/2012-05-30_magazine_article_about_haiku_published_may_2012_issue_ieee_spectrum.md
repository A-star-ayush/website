Long time Haiku contributor and Haiku, Inc. board of directors member Ryan Leavengood recently wrote an article about Haiku, which was just published in the May 2012 issue of IEEE Spectrum. For those Haiku community members who are IEEE members you can read the article in your print magazine, and all others can read <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-dawn-of-haiku-os/0">the whole article online</a>.

The Haiku project is always appreciative of any positive media coverage, and we want to thank Ryan for writing the article and the staff of IEEE Spectrum for publishing it. Ryan would also like to give a special thanks to his wonderful editor, Jean Kumagai. She help turn a mediocre article into a great one.
