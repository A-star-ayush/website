Project founder, long time leader and Haiku visionary Michael Phipps departed from the project last year. Michael's list of achievements is long: he did not just provide an overall vision for Haiku, but he also set up <a href="/about/haiku_inc">Haiku Inc.</a>, and over the years put in countless hours of work, keeping the development effort on track whenever it seemed to drift away from the goals, and single-handedly managing the infrastructure supporting the project. Without Michael, Haiku would most probably not be what it has become today.</p>

<p>Michael gave his goodbye in a <a href="http://haiku-os.org/blog/mphipps/2007-09-18/what_a_long_strange_trip_its_been">moving letter to the Haiku community</a> but, somehow, it feels as if we never reciprocated with a proper farewell. So we decided to do something special to show our heartfelt appreciation. We are thereby presenting Michael Phipps with the first ever <a href="/files/screenshots/2008-01-24_mphipps_award.thumbnail.jpg"  onclick="launch_popup(2012, 800, 572); return false;" target="_blank">Haiku Recognition Award</a>. This is a very special award with a personal touch, as it has been signed by members of the community present at the recent BeGeistert 018 conference held in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, and is also accompanied by a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pareAq4BmDM" target="_blank">farewell video</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you in the community who were not present at BeGeistert to sign the award, you can still show your appreciation to Michael, and we encourage you to do so by leaving your name and a short message in the comments area of this post. We are sure Michael will be reading them all.</p>

<p>Thank you again Michael, and we all wish you the best of luck in your future pursuits. The award and video are on their way. ;)</p>
