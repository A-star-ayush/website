                    <p><em>Update:</em> as of now this change is in effect. If you are encountering any problems, read on to learn how to get help.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/about/teams/website">website team</a> is constantly trying to improve the user experience of the various websites we maintain. In order to improve our existing infrastructure, we are currently preparing a move to a new server infrastructure, which is offered by the <a href="http://www.isc.org/">Internet Systems Consortium</a>. ISC is a non-profit that, amongst many <a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/profsvcs/">other things,</a> hosts <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>. We are more than grateful for this offer, which will improve our responsiveness, especially during exposure on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://www.osnews.com/">OSNews</a>.</p>

<p>This transition means that we have to redesign several aspects of the server infrastructure. One of these things is the user account handling. Because of the interactive nature of the main website and the bug tracker, much of the functionality is tied to user accounts. Up to now we have been able to use the user database of the main website to authenticate users against <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/">dev.haiku-os.org</a>. However, in the new environment, we have to break this connection, until a better solution is implemented.</p>

<p>On Monday the 9th of June, users of <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">dev.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span> will no longer be able to log in with the account they created on the main <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org">website.</a> If you have ever logged in on dev.haiku-os.org, you will be affected by this change. You will receive an email with a new (randomly generated) password, which you will be able to change to your liking.</p>

<p>Read on for a short list of questions and answers.</p>

<p><em>Q: I use dev.haiku-os.org on a regular basis. How will this influence my account details on <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">www.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span>?</em></p>

You will keep the same username and password you always had, and you can continue to log in on <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">www.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span> with those. Only your login information for <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">dev.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span> will change.</p>

<p><em>Q: I have never used <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">dev.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span>, but I would like to in the future. Should I log in now with my current account details before the change on Monday?</em></p>

<p>A: No. Monday a new link will appear which will allow you to register a new account on dev.haiku-os.org. You will be able to create a new account whenever it is necessary.</p>

<p><em>Q: I want to change my email address. Does this mean I have to do it in two places?</em></p>

<p>A: Yes. After Monday you will have to change your account details on both <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">www.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span> and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">dev.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span>.</p>

<p><em>Q: I am sure I have once logged in on <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">dev.<span style="color: #007788;">haiku</span><span style="color: #000040;">-</span>os.<span style="color: #007788;">org</span></code></span>, but I did not receive a new password. Neither can I register a new account under my old user name. What now?</em></p>

<p>A: Please send an email to <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/user/nielx">Niels Reedijk</a> (login required) with your user name and a description of your problem. </p>
