As many have likely noticed, our trusty mailing lists hosted on freelists.org are currently down.

It seems freelists.org is having some kind of critical DNS issue which hasn't yet been resolved. We have been unable to find out much info beyond that. If anyone has more details, please feel free to mention it in the comments.

However, since Haiku has a *lot* of mailing lists on freelists.org, this does drastically impact development and community discussion, we may have to relocate our mailing lists to another service if the problem doesn't get resolved soon.

We will be sure to let everyone know here if/when that occurs.

Thanks for you patience!

<strong>Update:</strong> The FreeLists server is up again and delayed mails are being delivered.
