                     <p>Since it appears that there may have been some confusion about the   recently announced Haiku Icon Contest , we want to make a few  clarifications in order to clear up any doubts about the contest.</p>  <p>The objective of the Haiku Icon Contest is to help develop design  guidelines for the eventual creation of a full Haiku Icon Set. Just to  give you an idea, the guidelines would look something like  <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/">the Tango guidelines</a>,  but would be specific to Haiku.</p>  <p>In order to achieve this goal, we are accepting artwork sample  submissions per the rules outlined in the &quot;Contest Rules&quot; section of the  <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/wiki/index.php?title=Icon_Contest"> Haiku Icon Contest official page</a>. The submitted artwork will  be rated in several areas by means of an online system. The rating  system will be open, so anyone interested will be able to participate;  take a peak at the <a href="http://bug-nordic.org/iconcontest/"> beta version rating page</a> to see what the rating system will look  like.</p>  <p>During and after the rating period, an open discussion will then be held  in the Haiku mailing list, as a brain storming exercise leading to the  Haiku icon design guidelines which will provide the base for the  creation of the final artwork.</p>  <p>Although the final icon set for Haiku will be the result of a  collaborative effort through the rating of the submitted artwork and an  open discussion in the Haiku mailing list, the contest will have a &quot;Best  Rated Entry&quot;, which will be awarded a special recognition certificate  from the Haiku project.</p>  <p>For other details about the contest, please refer to the  <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/wiki/index.php?title=Icon_Contest"> Haiku Icon Contest</a> page, which will be kept up to date with the latest  information.</p>  <h2>Haiku Icon Contest Summary</h2>  <ul><li>Deadline for submissions: September 1, 2006</li><li>Rating period: September 2 - 23, 2006</li><li>Rating page: To be announced</li><li>Rating tally: Beginning of October</li></ul>        </div>
