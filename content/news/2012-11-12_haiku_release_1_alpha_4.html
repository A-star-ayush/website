The Haiku Project is excited to announce the availability of our 
fourth official alpha release. A year and four months have passed 
since the Alpha 3 and the Haiku Project has been busy. The main 
purpose of this release is to provide interested third party 
developers with a stable version for testing and development. 
To aid with that, Haiku includes a rich set of development tools.

<h3>About Haiku</h3>
<p>
The Haiku Project is a volunteer based initiative and was started 
on August 18th, 2001. The goal of the project is to develop and 
promote the adoption of Haiku, an open source, general purpose 
operating system. Haiku adopts design concepts from the BeOS&reg; and 
takes it to the next level by infusing those concepts with recent 
advances in technology.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank all donors enabling development contracts funded 
through Haiku, Inc. and Haikuware's bounty program, the HSA for
organizing the BeGeistert conferences, and Google's Summer of Code 
and Google Code-in programs.
