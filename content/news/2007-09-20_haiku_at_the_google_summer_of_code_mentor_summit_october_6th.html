                    <p>Each year after the Summer of Code is over, Google holds an informal Mentor Summit at their Mountain View, CA office to allow mentors to meet each other and talk about their experiences in the program. This also allows Google to get first-hand suggestions on what was done right and what could be improved in the program. This year the Summit is being held on Saturday, October 6th.</p>
<p>I am glad to report that three Haiku mentors will be attending the Summit: Stephan AÃŸmus, Oliver Ruiz Dorantes and myself. In a continuing show of their support for open source, Google pays for airfare, one night hotel stay and food during the Summit.</p>
<p>In addition all three of us will be staying an extra day or two in the San Francisco/Mountain View area and are planning an informal Haiku community gathering on Sunday, October 7th. Any Haiku developers or community members in the area are welcome to join us. Further details will be provided as the date approaches. My colleagues and I are very excited about meeting any Haiku community members in the area.</p>
