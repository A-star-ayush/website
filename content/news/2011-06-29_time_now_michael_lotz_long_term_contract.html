<p>
Haiku, Inc. is ecstatic to announce
<b>Michael Lotz (AKA "mmlr") on a 6 month contract</b> developing Haiku!!
There is the intention to renew this contract for another 6 months,
making Michael to be the first person to be paid to work on Haiku for an
entire year and you can make that a reality!
</p>

<p>
The goal of his contract would be to work on anything and everything
to bring Haiku closer to its first production quality release, better known
as "R1". The scope, variety and quality of code that Michael has produced
over the past six years and even more recently, gives Haiku, Inc. the fullest
confidence in his ability to succeed in every task that he works on.
<b>Simply put, Michael gets the job done and done right.</b>
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here's some of his planned top priorities</p>
<ul>
	<li>offer assistance with WPA/WPA2 if not done</li>
	<li>additional polishing of usb_hid</li>
	<li>porting usb_scsi target (think USB CD writers)</li>
	<li>QEMU re-port including KVM, which allows hardware virtualization</li>
	<li>general bug hunting</li>
	<li>depending on access to hardware -- boot issues and driver issues</li>
</ul>

<p>
As mentioned above, this is something more than just a one or two month contract that has
been supported so far. In fact, <b>this would be a ground breaking event</b> --
both in terms of utilizing financial contributions to advance Haiku
and the time commitment from a developer. And you can help make it possible!
</p>

<p>
Ideally, this contract would be Michael's primary income for the entire year.
His monthly wage will be 2,300 CHF 
per month, which works out to about $16,500 USD for the first six months.
Each month, Michael will be committed to 130 hours of development time.
Between the monies from Haiku's participation in Google Summer of Code 2011,
the recent R1 Alpha 3 Commemorative CD and the average monthly donations,
the funding for the first six months will be possible.
The available funds would definitely be tight, but it can be done.
</p>

<p>
Michael actually quit his job in order to work full time on Haiku. He
is currently in the process of leaving his current employer, where he
needs to still stay a bit due to existing obligations. After that his
contract to work on Haiku will start, which will most likely be around the end of August.
</p>

<p>
Here are some more details about Michael Lotz.
He has been with the project for over six years.
During that time, his contributions ranged across the board.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>most of the USB stack, including working out the host
controller drivers, the stack itself and the interface up to the
userland via the USBKit.</li>
	<li>the initial native GCC 4 port for Haiku</li>
	<li>various drivers, including for USB devices and WLAN</li>
	<li>a framework to generically handle human interface devices and the
driver for USB HID devices that uses it</li>
	<li>the recent support for IO-APICs and IRQ routing to get many previously
non-usable devices working (read more at <a href="http://haikuware.com/20110510574/interview-michael-lotz">Haikuware</a>)</li>
	<li>other various firsts for Haiku can be read at Michael's <a href="http://haiku.mlotz.ch/">old blog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
As you can see, he has worked on pretty much all levels and components of Haiku
through hunting down bugs and implementing features.
