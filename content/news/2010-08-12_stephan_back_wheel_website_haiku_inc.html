<p>
Axel has now completed his contract, and intends to pursue the
Haikuware bounty for implementing the missing bits of WiFi support
over the next weeks.
</p>

<p>
Your generous donations are allowing us to continue contracting
Haiku developers for money. <strong>Thank-You-All for supporting these efforts!</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stephan has submitted (edit: and has been accepted for) a development contract</strong> -- 160 hours at $2000 USD.
Originally he proposed for additional features relating to WebPositive.
However in the scope of the next release and even R1 (Final),
other areas whose outstanding bugs and issues need greater attention:
</p>
<ul>
<li>app_server</li>
<li>MediaPlayer</li>
<li>Media Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>
Purchasing time and allocating it towards these areas will remove another obstacle while moving towards the great goal of R1.

Lastly in case you didn't hear yet,
<a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku/Introducing-haikuincorg-revised-TM-policy"
	>Haiku, Inc. has launched a website</a>
for itself! A few days ago, there was
<a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku/Reminder-HAIKU-logo-as-your-logo-B-OK"
	>a reminder that using or modifying the trademarked HAIKU logo as your logo is not `OK'</a>.
This is strictly about using the HAIKU logo as branding for your goods or services.
On the other hand, displaying the logo for saying <em>We support Haiku</em> or as part of an explanation of what is Haiku
is allowed and encouraged.
