                    <p><b>Note:</b> JMicron monitors user comments and encourages all Haiku supporters to post their comments at the Haiku Website, instead of mailing them directly. Thanks for your support!</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.jmicron.com" rel="nofollow">JMicron Technology Corporation</a> has offered to give our project support in the implementation of SATA technology for Haiku. JMicron has pledged to support the development effort by providing the required technical documentation as well as hardware for testing. Haiku developer Marcus Overhagen will be working closely with JMicron with the eventual goal of achieving full support for JMicron's SATA products in Haiku in the future. JMicron is a pioneer for SATA and PCI Express products. Haiku is an emerging multimedia desktop operating system. This cooperation will provide a solid foundation for multimedia applications.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Apparently, after the above announcement, JMicron got a number of mails expressing the appreciation of their support. They kindly asked us to add the following statement: <i>"It is so proud for JMicron to work with Haiku. No matter to others, JMicron would like to say thanks to all of you. For new coming chips, JMicron would like to get your great help as same as before."</i>.<br />
On behalf of the Haiku team, I want to thank JMicron for their offer, and I am looking forward to work with them.</p>
