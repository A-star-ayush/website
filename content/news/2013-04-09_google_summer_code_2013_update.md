Bummer!

We did not make it into Google Summer of Code this year. We were fortunate to be selected so often in the past, but apparently it's now time to let other projects benefit from this summer event; 177 out of 417 projects were chosen this year. GSoC 2012 went especially well for us though, which certainly makes this announcement that much more difficult to swallow. Congratulations and best wishes to the organizations that were accepted, and hopefully we'll have better luck next year.
