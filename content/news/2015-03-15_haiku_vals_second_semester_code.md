<p>The Haiku project is participating again in this year's "Semester of Code" (SoC) of the European <a href="http://vps2.semesterofcode.com/">VALS</a> project. The SoC is similar to Google's GSoC, but without the financial incentive and more emphasis on the educational side.<br />
This is the second installment of "SoC", the objective is still the same:</p>

<p>Its goal is to connect higher education students with open source projects to introduce them to the cooperative nature of working within a group on a bigger project. For Haiku, besides potentially extending its feature set, it's another opportunity to spark the interest of new, eager developers with a chance to gain future regular contributors.</p>

<p>There are currently 48 project proposals for Haiku on the <a href="http://vps2.semesterofcode.com/projects/browse">VALS projects page</a>.<br />
If you're a student and interested to take on a project, you have to act quick: the deadline for your application ends on <b>April, 1st 2015</b>! Sorry for the late notice...</p>
