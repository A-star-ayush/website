                    <p>In the past few days, there has been two important developments regarding our participating students.</p>

<p>Tom Fairfield has resigned from this year's Haiku Code Drive. Recently, he was accepted for a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program. This is a significant and important opportunity for him, especially since Tom is pursuing a continuing education in graduate school. However, the REU conflicts with the Haiku Code Drive timeline. As such, he decided to formally withdraw from HCD. To quote him: "I still plan on contributing code to Haiku - it's an awesome project but I must put it on hold for now. Thanks again for the opportunity though." We at Haiku wish you all the luck with your Research Experience for Undergraduate program and we are confident that you will succeed!</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, Raghu Nagireddy who was slotted for participation has returned from his absence and accepted our invitation to participate in this years Haiku Code Drive. Stephan AÃŸmus will be mentoring his project, which is largely centered around adding BFS support to FUSE. In the next day or so, Raghu will be creating his project summary blog post.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="/community/hcd2009/accepted">accepted students</a> will be updated to reflect these changes. Once again, we wish Tom the best of luck in his endeavors and congratulate Raghu on participating in HCD2009!</p>
