                    Yesterday was our big day at Google, and we can say with a good degree of confidence that the Haiku Tech Talk was quite successful. We had a very special guest for this event: former Be Inc. CEO Jean Louis Gass√©e, not only joined us at Google for our presentation, but also gave a few words of support and encouragement for our project. It was great to have JLG's presence, as well as that of the several ex-Be engineers who showed up for the talk. We were also glad to see JAVA for BeOS developer Andrew Bachman join us for this special event. Take a look at the <a href="http://haiku-os.org/index.php?q=gallery&g2_itemId=1288">pictures taken during the presentation</a>. A video of the full presentation will be posted on the web later this week; we will post the link here when it becomes available.        </div>
