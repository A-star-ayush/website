                    <p><strong>On behalf of Haiku, we'd like to wish everyone Happy Holidays!</strong></p>
<p>While the news may seem a little slow lately (people are likely busy during the holiday season), there has indeed been a few things happening of note.</p>
<p>One exciting <a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-development/Two-successful-final-year-projects" rel="nofollow">announcement was from Christof Lutteroth</a> letting us know that some final-year projects from the University of Auckland were prototyped using Haiku. While these prototypes and the code behind them are not yet publicly available, they have generously offered to donate this code to Haiku in the future.</p>
<p>In other developments, we have seen some improvements to Haiku's network drivers, including a <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/changeset/28752" rel="nofollow">couple</a> <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/changeset/28771" rel="nofollow">drivers</a> ported from FreeBSD by Ithamar Adema to improve the wired LAN support for EeePCs. Ithamar has also reported that he would like to work on <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1050" rel="nofollow">porting FreeBSD's wireless stack where Fredrik Holmqvist left off</a>.</p>
<p>It also seems that Oliver Ruiz Dorantes <a href="http://urnenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/11/5th6th-milestone-phase-1-reached.html" rel="nofollow">has recently completed Phase 1</a> of his Bluetooth stack and thus <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/blog/kvdman/2008-11-29/bluetooth_bounty_complete" rel="nofollow">completed the associated Haikuware bounty</a>.</p>
<p>There have been many other improvements to Haiku recently and you can always see what's going on in the <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/timeline" rel="nofollow">Haiku Trac Timeline</a> if you need a "quick fix". :)</p>
