                    <p>After the cancelation of WalterCon 2007 in San Francisco, the few that already registered for the event took their already bought airplane tickets as an opportunity to organise a community driven replacement for that event.</p>
<p>They called their gathering FalterCon 2007 - with the obvious pun intended. It's held on Saturday, August 11, from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM in the Sunnyvale Baylands Park at the <a href="http://www.linuxpicnic.org/" rel="nofollow">Linux 16th Anniversary Picnic</a>. You're welcome to join them if you live in the area, but of course also if you don't :-)</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://www.myhaiku.org/faltercon/" rel="nofollow">website they've put up</a> for the event. The Haiku project wants to thank those that made this alternative gathering possible!</p>
