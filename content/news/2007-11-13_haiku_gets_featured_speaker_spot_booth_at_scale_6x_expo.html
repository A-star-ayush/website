Yes, you read well: we will not only have a booth (for the second consecutive year), but Haiku developer and “Googler” Bruno G. Albuquerque will also be presenting our project and operating system as one of the few featured speakers that SCaLE invites every year among prominent members of the open source community. This is the first time Haiku is awarded a speaker spot at a renowned open source event, and we are proud of this achievement.</p>
