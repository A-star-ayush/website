                    <p>After a quite intensive and challenging review and selection process, we are pleased to announce that Haiku has been assigned <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/haiku/about.html">five (5) student slots for the Google Summer of Code 2008</a>. This year, Google accepted many more mentor organizations than ever before, which made the allotment of students slots a lot more competitive. We also received applications of very high quality, which is definitely a blessing, but also made the Haiku mentor's task of narrowing down to a final selection much tougher. After thorough review of all the applications, and carefully taking into consideration factors such as immediate benefits for our project, the likelihood of getting long-term contributors, and the availability of an appropriate mentor for any given project, we have come up with the final list of students that will be coding for Haiku during the GSoC 2008 program. Here it is:</p>

<p>Please join us in giving a warm welcome to all the accepted students. Make them feel part of the Haiku community, as we want them to stay beyond the summer. And remember: their success is our success, so anything that we can do to assist the students complete their GSoC project successfully is for our benefit too.</p>

<p>We also want to thank all the other students that applied for a Haiku project but could not make it. We would have liked to accept them all, but that is sadly not possible. That being said, we are considering our own summer of code to sponsor one or more projects on our own, so please stick around. Better yet, if you are interested in this idea, <a href="/user/263/contact">contact us to discuss the details</a>. To the community, stay tuned for more details, as you may have an opportunity to help make this happen.</p>

<p>Last but not least, a big thank you to the Haiku mentors who are committing their time to the success of this year's Google Summer of Code and, of course, to Google itself for making this happen and giving us the opportunity to participate again this year.</p>
