                    While this is not part of the core Haiku development, we still feel it is important for our platform and our Haiku fans to report this news. We are excited to tell you that Haiku developer Michael Lotz is porting the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">open source Flash player Gnash</a> to Haiku. This port is based on the latest Gnash 0.7.2 release, and uses the AGG rendering backend (which Haiku uses for its graphics system), and a native GUI. Michael has also developed a Firefox plugin based on his <a href="http://svg.mlotz.ch/">SVG plugin for BeOS</a>. Read all the details and check out the screenshots at <a href="http://joomla.iscomputeron.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=924&Itemid=2">iscomputeron.com</a>.
