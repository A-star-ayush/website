We are happy to announce that the trademark registration process of the HAIKU logo&reg; has <a href="http://www.haiku-inc.org/documents/haiku_inc-uspto-registration_certificate-85093759.pdf">finally been completed (pdf)</a> by <a href="http://haiku-inc.org/">Haiku, Inc.</a>

<p>
Over the last year or two, Haiku, Inc. has been seeking to cleanup the Haiku trademark usage. The official registration of the logo was a major part of that process.There are several <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/smallbusiness/trademarks/registering.html">benefits of having Federal trademark registration</a>,
which include fortifying the protection of the mark and entitling additional methods of resolving trademark infringers. As R1 continually draws nearer, having this additional recognition and protection is a good thing.
<p>
Haiku, Inc. <a href="http://haiku-inc.org/trademarks.html">provides a page</a> describing the trademarks and their proper usage.
