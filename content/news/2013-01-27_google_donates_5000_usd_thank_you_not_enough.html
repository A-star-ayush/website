<p>
What an upbeat way to start the new year! 
<strong>Google, Inc. has donated Five-Thousand Dollars to Haiku, Inc.</strong>
Earlier in December, a Google employee contacted the project to coordinate 
their donation. The transaction was received this month and shows as part 
of 2013's fundraising progress. This donation will greatly assist in securing 
additional development time specifically for HAIKU!
Thank you Google, Inc!

<p>
For the curious, while Google has made payments to Haiku, Inc. in the past,
they were for mentoring services rendered during Google Summer of Code and
travel reimbursements (for sending two mentors to attend the associated 
Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit). In other words, 
<strong>this is the first actual donation from Google, Inc!</strong>
Hopefully this signals that in the eyes of corporations and similar entities,
Haiku is gaining recognition as a usable operating system 
and worthy of investment.

In the past few years, our financial health has continued to accelerate, 
both in terms of who is donating and how many times each person makes a 
donation. Here is a quick break down on the number of individual people 
who donated and the number of donations per year:

<p>
Some anecdotal background information will help interpret those numbers.
Haiku, Inc. started accepting donations in 2005.
The first year in which a formal call for donations for development purposes
was the Haiku Code Drive in 2008, which provided contracts to 
Google Summer of Code applicants that were not selected as accepted students.
From a fund raising perspective, the call for donations was very successful 
and raised several thousand dollars in a single month. 
(Though from looking at the produced results, it was less than expected.
	As an eventual result, development contracts became available only 
	to existing contributors with a known reputation.)
September 2009 was Haiku's initial public release: R1 alpha 1.
Finally, in 2010 Haiku, Inc. returned to providing existing contributors 
with development contracts. Since then, the growth has dramatically 
and steadily increased. Thank you everyone who has helped!
</p>

<p>
Speaking of development contracts since 2010, almost $29,000 USD has been used
to pay for 2,010 hours of dedicated development time.
That averages to a meager $14 USD per hour! And that brings us to the present.
</p>

<ul> 
 <li>$44,000 in available funds</li>
 <li><i>minus</i> $11,000 for scheduled contracts</li>
 <li>= $33,000 available cash</li>
</ul>

<p>
There have been some quick discussions with contributors to feel out the 
potentials for additional contracts. At this time, nothing is set in stone.
One thing is for certain, it is becoming increasingly challenging to find 
contributors who are willing and able to adjust their schedules for a short 
term development contract. There have been several suggestions of pursuing 
a crowdfunding effort, to enough funding to pay more competitive rates 
for a longer term contract. This is an exciting prospect, but a contributor 
needs to express interest in longer term contracts.
</p>

<p>
Contributors, who are interested in contractual work, should read more 
information about submitting a request for funds and contact Haiku, Inc.
