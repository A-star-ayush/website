                    <p>It is with much regret and disappointment that I must announce that the Haiku project have decided to cancel WalterCon 2007 for lack of community interest. Those who have already registered will have all money refunded.</p>
<p>The perceived reason for this would be late announcement combined with the community being spread across the globe. Efforts are already under way to prevent such problems stemming from last-minute planning and to make WalterCon not only a success, but a hit.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, Michael Phipps has been invited to speak at the upcoming LinuxWorld conference. This is an excellent opportunity for exposure for Haiku both as a project and as a community.</p>
