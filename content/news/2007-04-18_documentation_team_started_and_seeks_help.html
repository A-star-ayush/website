                    <p>With the release of the BeBook under the Creative Commons license, <a href="http://www.access-company.com/" rel="nofollow">ACCESS Co. Ltd</a> enables us to provide the potential developers of today with all the documentation of the BeOS API. But to ensure that API documentation will be available and up to date for the future generations of developers, the Haiku project announces a structured effort on the writing of the Haiku API documentation from scratch. The documentation team is small and young and any help would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping out with writing, verifying and/or correcting API documentation, or you're interested in following the documentation process, please have a look at the <a href="http://haiku-os.org/about/teams/documentation" rel="nofollow">team page</a>. A snapshot of the currently written documentation is available at the <a href="http://factory.haiku-os.org/documentation/Haiku_Book_doxygen/html/" rel="nofollow">build factory</a>, and will kept up to date daily from the latest sources.</p>
