                    <p>The Dutch magazine <a href="http://www.pc-active.nl/" rel="nofollow">PC-Active</a> published an article on Haiku in their October issue, based on an interview I gave a few months ago. We are even on the cover! From the article: &quot;Years ago, the alternative operating system BeOS had a small, but very loyal group of supporters. They had a strong belief in the future of 'their' operating system. In 2001, the company behind BeOS ceased to exist. Now, half way through 2007, there is a new group enthousiastic followers. Haiku followers, the reincarnation of BeOS.&quot; The article mentions the current status of the project, the history and the open source nature.</p>
<p>If you live in The Netherlands or in Belgium, it's a worthwile read!</p>
