This makes Haiku the first OS platform to be sponsored by the Porters Group, and it means that the port is now officially part of the OpenJDK family of projects endorsed by Sun. Referring to the Haiku Java Team proposal, OpenJDK Ambassador for Sun Microsystems Tom Marble said: "I believe that encouraging broad adoption of OpenJDK on as many operating systems and architectures as possible is essential to furthering our goals of Java ubiquity. I'm glad to support this project."<p>

<!--break-->

<p>Sun is now expected to setup infrastructure such as a mailing list, website and source repository for this project under the OpenJDK umbrella. The specifics of this infrastructure will be published on the <a href="http://haiku-os.org/about/teams/java">Haiku Java Team page</a> as they become available. In the meantime, if you would like to join the team, please contact team lead <a href="http://haiku-os.org/user/346/contact">Bryan Varner</a>.</p>

<p>We are proud and excited that the Haiku Java Team has joined the OpenJDK project, and we look forward to the future fruits of their effort. Join us in congratulating Bryan Varner and his team for this initial but important step in bringing Java technologies to Haiku.</p>
