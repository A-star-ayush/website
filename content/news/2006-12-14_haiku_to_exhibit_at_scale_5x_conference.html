                    <p>We are excited to announce that the Haiku Project is scheduled to exhibit at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale5x/">SCaLE 5x</a>, the Fifth Annual Southern California Linux Expo, to be held at <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1005">The Westin Los Angeles Airport</a> hotel on the weekend of February 10 and 11, 2007. This is our debut at a major open source conference and represents an important first step towards becoming a widely recognized member of the global open source community.</p>

<p>Specifics of the Haiku exhibit are still being discussed and will be announced at a later date. We wanted to inform the community as soon as possible, not only out of sheer excitement, but also in the hope that some of you may offer to help out, or even just drop by and support us, in order to make this a memorable event for Haiku.</p>

<p>So if you are in the area or feel adventurous enough to drive or fly over for a weekend in LA, here is another opportunity to help the advancement of Haiku. If you are interested in taking part, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> so that we can discuss the areas where you can help out (select "Marketing" under category in the contact form).</p>

<p>SCaLE is an open source event started in 2002 that gathers open source communities, academic institutions and commercial exhibitors such as IBM and Google. More than one thousand people attended SCaLE 4x early this year, and attendance is expected to grow in 2007.
