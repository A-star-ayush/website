For the sixth time <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/">Google's Code-In</a> program attracts students of the ages 13 to 17 from all over the world to work with open source projects. Haiku is once again proud to take part and is one of 14 mentor organizations that will supply tasks and guidance. The tasks range from coding and documentation to quality assurance and research. Each task is relatively small and should be accomplished in 3 to 6 hours.

As we can (and should) add more tasks as the program moves along, suggestions are still welcome. Please use our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ozlfjZ-miL81zKIVICxiv0-wXPTUhYjROIE83IYqvYY/viewform">web form</a>.

GCI starts on the 7th of December 2015 and ends on the 25th of January 2016.
Please welcome our students in the #haiku IRC channel or the forums and help out by answering their questions if you can!
