                    <p>September 23 was the last day of the rating period for the Haiku Icon Contest. We want to thank the authors of the great artistic work submitted to the contest, as well as those who took the time to rate the icons. Interest in the contest was very high, as reflected by the more than two thousand unique visitors that made their voice heard during the three week rating period.</p>
<p>We are now going to review the results of the rating, and also evaluate the feedback received from the community via the mailing list, in order to come up with the official Haiku Icon Guidelines. It is our intent to showcase the new Haiku icon set for the first time next month at WalterCon 2006, where we will also announce the winner of the Best Rated Icon Set Award. Stay tuned.</p>
