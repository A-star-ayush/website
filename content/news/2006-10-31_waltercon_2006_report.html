Jem Matzan of <a href="http://www.thejemreport.com">The Jem Report</a> was at WalterCon, and he has written an interesting <a href="http://www.thejemreport.com/mambo/content/view/288/">article on the conference</a> that gives an overview of the event, and also makes some insightful observations as someone new to the project and the platform.</p>

<p>Jem also recorded video footage of the State of Haiku address by Michael Phipps, and a few walk around interviews; the video is being edited, and is expected to become available for download shortly. Additionally, the <a href="http://waltercon.haiku-os.org/modules/xoopsgallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album02">WalterCon 2006 photo library</a> already has a good number of photos and a few short video clips too, so head over and take a peek.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://sikosis.com/haiku/HaikuRocks.mpg">promo video</a> produced by DarWyrm titled "Haiku Rocks" was also shown for the first time at WalterCon. This two minute video shows Haiku in action, and is a nice means to showcase how far Haiku has come so far.</p>

<p>We want to thank all the attendees, the members of the community who helped make WalterCon happen, our sponsors, and to Jem Matzan for taking the time to attend and report on WalterCon. A special thank you goes to Michael Phipps, who did most of the work to make WalterCon a reality.</p>
