<p>Late as always the registration for the 25th BeGeistert event is now open at last. Head over to <a href="http://www.begeistert.org/">www.begeistert.org</a> if you want to take part in it.</p>

<p>The jubilee event is taking place at the youth hostel DÃ¼sseldorf as usual. Many of Haiku's core developers will attend, and discuss the future of Haiku among other things. It's a social event where Haiku developers and users come together to share their ideas, and experiences, even though there will also be workshops, and presentations for those interested. The complete program is still being worked, on though.</p>

<p>This time, there is no coding sprint, however, but to compensate for that a bit, the event includes the monday as well.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot to Charlie Clark and the <a href="http://haiku-support-association.org/">Haiku Support Association e.V.</a> for their tedious task of planning and organizing the events in all these years!</p>
