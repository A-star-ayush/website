                    <p>As another avenue to spread awareness of the Haiku project, the Haiku project has opened a store for official Haiku merchandise at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/haiku_os/">CafePress</a>. Find T-shirts, mousepads, coffee mugs, and more! Most items are sold at Haiku's cost and any proceeds go directly to Haiku. Read more for how you can contribute designs for the store. What's more is that this is a community-driven effort. Got a great idea for Haiku stuff? Here are the guidelines:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>

<li>Send us a link to the proposed design through our <a href="/contact">online contact form</a> (login required).</li>

<li>Designs should be attractive and avoid objectionable content (off-color remarks, obscenities, etc.)</li>

<li>All accepted submissions become property of Haiku, Inc. This is just to avoid legal troubles.</li>

<li>Design approval decisions of the Haiku project are final.</li>

<li>Acceptable file formats for submissions are Adobe Illustrator, EPS, and SVG.</li>

<li>Suggestions for the types of merchandise for the design are encouraged (mugs, mouse pads, messenger bags, posters, etc.).</li>

</ol>

<p>There will also be a page dedicated to information about the store on our website in the near future.</p>
