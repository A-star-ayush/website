Haiku has now been invited to have a booth at the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/" target="_blank">LugRadio Live USA 2008</a>, the first LugRadio live event to be held in the US. Needless to say, we could not refuse the irresistible offer. The event will take place in San Francisco on the weekend of April 12 and 13, at the <a href="http://westfield.com/metreon/" target="_blank">The Metreon</a> entertainment center located at the heart of the city (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=101+4th+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA&sll=37.785131,-122.404389&sspn=0.007953,0.014849&ie=UTF8&ll=37.786148,-122.404282&spn=0.007953,0.014849&z=16&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">map</a>).</p>

<p>LugRadio is an event that covers a range of topics about free software, Open Source, digital rights, technology and more. Combined with a compelling list of speakers, exhibitors and birds of a feather sessions, this event is said to offer what feels like a combination of a rock concert and a computer conference. To bring this unique atmosphere to San Francisco, LugRadio Live USA 2008 USA will have around <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/speakers" target="_blank">30 speakers</a> including Miguel de Icaza and Ian Murdock, <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/exhibition" target="_blank">over 20 exhibitors</a>, an eclectic range of BOF and other sessions, and the live recording of LugRadio in front of an audience.</p>
