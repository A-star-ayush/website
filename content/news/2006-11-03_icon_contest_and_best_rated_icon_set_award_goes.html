<p>The community has spoken, and as project leader Michael Phipps recently announced at <a href="http://waltercon.haiku-os.org">WalterCon 2006</a>, we have a winner for the <strong>Best Rated Icon Set Award</strong>: the honor goes to Stephan Assmus, for his <a href="http://bug-no.petterhj.net/iconcontest/visualizer/?set=stippi&size=&res=1">Stippi icon set</a>. Stippi came in first place with the highest average rating, closely followed in second place by the <a href="http://bug-no.petterhj.net/iconcontest/visualizer/?set=honey&size=&res=1">Honey</a>, <a href="http://bug-no.petterhj.net/iconcontest/visualizer/?set=zumi&size=&res=1">Zumi</a> and <a href="http://bug-no.petterhj.net/iconcontest/visualizer/?set=mcclintock&size=&res=1">Mc Clintock</a> icon sets.</p>

<p>With the results of the open rating in hand, there is now work left towards creating the final icon guidelines. We want to remind everyone that the rating was carried out as a means to give the community a chance to make their voice heard, and while you can expect to see a heavy influence from the best rated Stippi icon set, chances are that the final icon set to be used as the default in Haiku will also see an influence from the other submitted icon sets as well.</p>

<p>The overall quality of the submitted icon sets was superb. The valuable contributions from the talented authors of these icon sets will help make a great UI for Haiku, and for that we are endlessly grateful.</p>

<p>On a related note, we are also pleased to announce that Stephan has also implemented support for vector icons in OpenTracker, and his work is expected to be committed to the Haiku repository in the near future. Thanks for your great work Stephan!</p>
