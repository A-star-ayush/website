As a result, haiku-os.org is scheduled to operate in read-only mode from approximately September 9th at 17:00 through the 14th at 00:00AM (UTC). During this time, no major outages are expected and the website will be online for the most part, but the following operations will be disabled:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Creating new accounts</li>
 <li>Editing existing accounts</li>
 <li>Posting new content (to forums, blogs, documents, etc.)</li>
 <li>Editing any existing content</li>
 <li>Posting new comments or editing existing ones</li>
</ul>

<p>The upgraded website is scheduled to be fully operational in time for the Alpha 1 release date. Until then, please use the <a href="/community/ml" title="Haiku Mailing Lists">mailing lists</a> or our <a href="/community/irc" title="Haiku IRC channels">IRC channels</a> as means of communication with the community. Our bug reporting tool <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org" title="Haiku bug tracking toll">http://dev.haiku-os.org</a> is unaffected, and will continue to operate as usual.</p>
