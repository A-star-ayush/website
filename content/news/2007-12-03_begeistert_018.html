                    <p>Many Haiku fans have been eagerly waiting for the next BeGeistert, and the official word is out now: <a href"http://www.begeistert.org">BeGeistert 018 -- Phoenix</a> is coming back to Düsseldorf, where it will be held on January 12 and 13, 2008. But the good news does not end here: as a prelude to BeGeistert, a coding asylum event with the expected presence of many Haiku core developers has been organized on the same week and at the sample place.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In this, it's 18th edition, BeGeistert is going back to the recently renovated Youth Hostel Düsseldorf, the same place that has hosted this community event so many times in the past. The program for BeGeistert is known to develop in the run up to the event itself, but you can expect a wide array of presentations and workshops, most of which will be directly or indirectly related to Haiku. This will most likely include a Haiku development progress report from one or more of the core Haiku developers, as well as an update on the status of Haiku Inc., the non-profit supporting the Haiku project. There are also plans to present and demo, for the first time in public, a Haiku-based commercial application that has been quietly in development for the last two years. The Youth Hostel Düsseldorf where BeGeistert 018 will take place is located in the Oberkassel district, opposite to the historic city center and directly on the bank of the Rhine. This gives BeGeistert participants also a chance to enjoy numerous interesting sightseeing spots conveniently located at walking distance.</p>

<p>Several Haiku developers plan to kick off the coding session early: they’ll start already on the 8th. This meeting has been spontaneously organized to give Haiku development a last minute kick before the demonstrations during BeGeistert. These well known Haiku developers will participate in the coding session:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ithamar R. Adema</li>
<li>Stephan Aßmus</li>
<li>Axel Dörfler</li>
<li>Jérôme Duval</li>
<li>Michael Lotz</li>
<li>Marcus Overhagen</li>
<li>François Revol</li>
<li>Oliver Tappe</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a Haiku developer and would like to attend this coding event, please contact <a href="http://haiku-os.org/user/263/contact">Stephan Aßmus</a>, geek liaison officer of the BeGeistert Orga-Team.</p>

<p>BeGeistert is an event that has been providing the BeOS user and developer communities a venue to gather for almost ten years. First celebrated in Düsseldorf, on December 1998, BeGeistert is organized by Charlie Clark and the rest of the BeGeistert Orga-Team. This coming chapter of the event is shaping up to become a BeGeistert on steroids, and an action packed week for Haiku too, so don't miss it!</p>
