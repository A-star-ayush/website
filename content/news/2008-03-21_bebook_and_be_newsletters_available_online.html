                    <p><img src="http://www.haiku-os.org/files/screenshots/access-be.png" alt="" title="" align="right" />It's been almost one year since <a href="/news/2007-04-03/access_co_releases_bebook_and_be_newsletters" rel="nofollow">we announced our conversations with ACCESS Co. Ltd.</a> targeted at releasing legacy BeOS related documents, and today we are happy to inform the community that this project has finally arrived to a happy conclusion: the <a href="/legacy-docs/bebook/" rel="nofollow">BeBook</a> and all the <a href="/legacy-docs/benewsletter/" rel="nofollow">Be Newsletters</a> are now available online. As an emerging open source project, documentation for Haiku is still hard to come by; and while our <a href="/about/teams/documentation" rel="nofollow">Documentation Team</a> works on creating Haiku-specific material, the BeBook and the Be Newsletters will provide valuable reference material for all developers, new and experienced alike. We want to express our gratitude to <a href="http://www.access-company.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">ACCESS Co., Ltd.</a> for supporting our project, particularly to Director of Open Source Technologies David "Lefty" Schlesinger, for personally following up on our request. Special thanks also go to community member Simon Kennedy, for nicely formatting the documents for us.</p>
