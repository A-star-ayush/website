Last week, Haiku, Inc. accepted a 120 hour contract for Dario Casalinuovo.

Over the course of a month, Dario will be working on streaming support, improving the media_server, and improving/integrating the BMediaClient.

You can read more about his contract proposal <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-inc/Contract-Proposal-Streaming-Support-and-Media-Kit-Development">here</a>. Keep an eye on his <a href="/blog/barrett">blog</a> for updates on his progress.

To further support Dario's contract, Dane of <a href="http://tunetrackersystems.com/">TuneTracker Systems</a> has donated $500 USD.

Dario has expressed his willingness to work on other areas of Haiku in the future once he has improved the media_kit, which is the area he is currently most comfortable working with.
