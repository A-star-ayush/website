                    <p>On Monday the 16th of June, from 09:00 GMT onwards, <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/" rel="nofollow">dev.haiku-os.org</a> will be down for a server move and software upgrade. The website team has chosen to combine these two operations in order to minimize downtime. The operation is expected to take about three hours. Live progress updates will be offered on the<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/%23haiku" rel="nofollow">#haiku</a> channel on <a href="http://freenode.net" rel="nofollow">freenode.</a> </p>
<p>The service will be moved to hosting that has been offered by Scott Palmer from <a href="http://www.unixheads.org" rel="nofollow">Unixheads.org</a>, a non-profit that is dedicated to providing hosting and mirroring services to open source projects. We would like to thank Scott Palmer and Unixheads.org for their very generous offer to take over the hosting of one of our services that is so vital for the community.</p>
