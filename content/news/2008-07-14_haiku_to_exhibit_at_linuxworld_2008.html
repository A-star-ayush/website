Since then, Haiku has made appearances in <a href="/conference/">many open source events worldwide</a>. One big event that we have been targeting since last year was the LinuxWorld Expo; unfortunately, both this and last year we were unable to get a spot in the .Org pavilion. Fortunately, that's about to change. After some perseverance, creative thinking and thanks the good will of <a href="http://www.idgworldexpo.com/live/wec/">IDG World Expo</a> (the organizers of LinuxWorld) and the <a href="http://www.reactos.org">ReactOS</a> project (with whom we will be sharing the booth), we are excited to announce that we were able to obtain an exhibit spot at the <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/">LinuxWorld Expo 2008</a> to be held next month in the <a href="http://www.moscone.com">San Francisco Moscone Center</a>.</p>

<p>We have secured a full-sized 10x10 spot (booth #1617), where we plan to showcase Haiku for the full duration of the expo, that is, August 5, 6 and 7. Our plan is to demo Haiku on two or more PCs, one of them hooked up to a projector which will display its image on a screen hanging from the booth backwall (<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/haiku.inc/SCaLE6x/photo#5166963800208274690">like here</a>). We will also hand out fliers and possibly a CD with a VMWare image, and sell Haiku t-shirts (if allowed) to raise funds for the project.</p>

<p>LinuxWorld has an average attendance of more than 10,000 people. This is many times more compared to the conferences that we have been attending in the past. Exhibitors include big names like IBM, ORACLE, ACCESS, CISCO, Fujitsu and Canonical, along with well-known open source projects like Fedora, Drupal, FreeBSD and Gentoo among others. Of course, the media is expected to cover the event, so the opportunities for coverage will potentially also be there. All in all, LinuxWorld offers us a great opportunity for very high-profile exposure, which makes it all the more exciting.</p>
