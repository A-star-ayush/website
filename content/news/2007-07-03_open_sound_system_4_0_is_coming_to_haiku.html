                    <p>Haiku developer Fran&ccedil;ois Revol has done an initial port of the <a href="http://www.opensound.com/" rel="nofollow">Open Sound System</a> to Haiku. OSS has been open sourced by 4front Technologies recently, and powers the audio hardware of many Unix derivates.</p>
<p>OSS features an impressive list of supported devices - the port aims to seemlessly integrate with Haiku's media subsystem, the OSS drivers will just work like any other of the currently available audio drivers.</p>
<p>For further information, please refer to <a href="http://mailman.opensound.com/pipermail/oss-devel/2007-June/000028.html" rel="nofollow">this announcement</a> made on the OSS developer mailing list.</p>
