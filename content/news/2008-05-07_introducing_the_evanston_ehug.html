                    <p>I am pleased to announce that a new Haiku User Group is being started in Chicago. The Evanston Haiku User Group (eHUG) is the second user group in the US focused on Haiku, and we have a temporary website at <a href="http://ehug.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ehug.wordpress.com</a>. We are very similar to other user groups already in existence, but one of the differences between the eHUG and other HUGs is the fact that one of our primary goals is to design and build a computer specifically for Haiku. We currently have two members and the president of the group is Yuri Wordsmith, myself.</p>
