                    <p>This year for Haiku Code Drive, the student selection process has been completely overhauled. Unlike last year, where a public vote was held to select the students, our mentors have determined the combinations of &lt;student&gt;-&lt;project&gt;-&lt;mentor&gt;. Since our requirements for <i>Google Summer of Code</i> were greatly improved upon from last year, our mentors were able to confidently decide which of those combinations have the highest chance of succeeding. </p>

<p>There were several issues that limited this list. First, it is of utmost importance that <i>Google Summer of Code</i> remains the top priority. Based on that, the mentors have agreed that is not in the best interest of Haiku to encourage mentoring more than one student. Students such as <a href="http://www.haikuware.com/an-interview-with-google-summer-of-code-applicant-francesco-piccinno">Francesco Piccinno</a> and <a href="http://www.haikuware.com/an-interview-with-google-summer-of-code-applicant-jisheng-zhang">JiSheng Zhang</a> are participating in <i>Google Summer of Code</i> with other organizations and therefore are not eligible to participate in this year's Haiku Code Drive. Some students simply failed to reply to our requests to participate. Lastly, other students did not have someone capable of effectively mentoring them.</p>

<p>The format of Haiku Code Drive 2009, will in large be similar to last year. The timeline will closely follow <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs#timeline">Google Summer of Code's timeline</a>. A stipend of $2,500 USD will be provided to successfully completed projects. Non-completed projects will be considered for half payment. The students will be encouraged to maintain a blog, provided to them on this website, with status updates. In general, they will be treated with the same respect and courtesy as our students who are participating through Google.</p>

<p>The finances for both students is already secured. As you may recall, some students from <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2008-10-07/google_summer_of_code_2008_and_haiku_code_drive_harvest">last year's Haiku Code Drive</a> did not complete their projects. Due to this, $2,500 was left over and earmarked for future use. The other half of the money was paid to Haiku for our participation in <i>Google Summer of Code</i> 2008.</p>        </div>
