                    <p>Haiku Inc. recently received from Google a check for $4,000 for its participation in the last <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/">Google Summer of Code 2007</a> program. This is ten percent of the total $40,000 that Google disbursed to sponsor the <a href="http://haiku-os.org/news/2007-04-11/its_official_eight_students_to_code_for_haiku_at_gsoc_2007">eight Haiku related projects</a> alloted for GSoC 2007. We want to thank Google for giving us the opportunity to participate in the program for the first time this year, and hope they will consider us again for next year.</p>

<p>The Google Summer of Code is a program designed to sponsor students to work in open source projects during the three summer months. Open source software projects like Haiku apply to become mentoring organizations, and put forward projects that students from all over the world can apply for. The mentoring organizations provide mentors to guide the students throughout the program and to assist them in the successful completion of their project. For each successfully completed project, Google pays $4,500 to the student and $500 to the mentoring organization.</p>

Can you find Stephan and Oliver?</strong></span></span>Haiku's application to the GSoC was accepted for the first time in 2007, and Google assigned us eight student slots, for Haiku projects covering areas as varied as the network stack, USB, Firewire, a package installer, a new scheduler and more (here is a <a href="http://haiku-os.org/news/2007-09-19/2007_google_summer_of_code_summary">summary of the results</a>). Needless to say, we will be applying for GSoC 2008 next year as well, and plan to mobilize the community again as soon as Google announces the details of next year's program.</p>

<p>Finally, we also want to give special thanks to Axel Dörfler, Oliver Ruiz Dorantes, Jérôme Duval, Stephan Aßmus, Ryan Leavengood and François Revol, all of whom volunteered as mentors to make it possible for Haiku to have as many as eight students in our GSoC debut. Oliver, Ryan and Stephan were later invited to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit held last October 6th at the Google Mountain View headquarters, where they proudly represented the Haiku project among many mentors from other open source projects.</p>
