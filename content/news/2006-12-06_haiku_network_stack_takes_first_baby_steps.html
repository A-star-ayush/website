After <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/haiku-commits/2006-December/009647.html">this commit</a>, Axel himself and several others have reported successfully running the Vision IRC client in Haiku. Setting up the network requires editing a couple of configuration files, but it should be fairly straighforward for those brave enought to give it a try; Axel explains <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/haiku-commits/2006-December/009649.html">how to do it here</a>.</p>

<p>Great work Axel!</p>
