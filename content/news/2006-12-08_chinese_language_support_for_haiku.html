                    <p>We are pleased to announce that Haiku has taken its first steps towards supporting the Chinese language. Developer Anthony Lee has graciously donated to Haiku the code of BeCJK, an input server add-on based input method which will allow Haiku users to enter text in the Chinese language.</p>

<p>We have now set out to find a good set of Chinese fonts that could be used in Haiku, and Anthony is giving us some advise on that front too. As a result of these efforts, we expect Haiku to be able to input and display Chinese text sometime in the future.</p>

<p>We want to thank Anthony Lee for his gracious code donation as well as for his knowledgeable advise. I take the opportunity to remind other regional community members that we are open to advise and recommendations on how to expand the internationalization capabilities of Haiku.</p>        </div>
