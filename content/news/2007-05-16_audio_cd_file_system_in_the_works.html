                    [img_assist|nid=1687|title=CDDA-FS running in Haiku|desc=|link=popup|align=right|width=200|height=136]<p>Haiku developer Axel DÃ¶rfler has started to work on a CDDA file system 
for playing audio CDs for Haiku. CDDA-FS allows Haiku users to view 
and play music tracks from mounted audio CDs as if they were WAV files. 
CDDA-FS also supports CD-Text which means that information like album 
titles, artist names, and song titles available from the CD itself will 
be shown as file attributes, so that they can be viewed and edited in 
Tracker.</p>

<p>While CDDA-FS is not finished yet, it can already be used to play back 
CD contents as you can see from the screenshot. The file system is 
accompanied by a small test application "cdda_text" which also runs 
under BeOS and prints all information CDDA-FS can retrieve from the 
specified CD.</p><!--more-->
