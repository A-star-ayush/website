<h3>Haiku Exhibit</h3>
<p>We will be at booth #42. We are planning on having a projector running Haiku on a backwall screen, and a couple of hands-on PCs so that visitors can actually play with Haiku. Project leader Michael Phipps along with Haiku developers Axel Dörfler and Bruno G. Albuquerque will be available on-site. Feel free to stop by to find out about the project or to discuss technical details of Haiku. We look forward to seeing everyone!</p>
