<p>Yesterday, Google has assigned 7 preliminary student slots to us, which is as many as we wanted to have. Haiku would like thank all the students that have applied for projects and those that have assisted in this step of the program. Overall, we received 42 student applications. In the next days we will finalize the list of accepted student projects for Haiku.</p>

<p>At 0:00 UTC on April 12, 2007, the list of accepted student applications will be posted on <a href="http://code.google.com">code.google.com</a>. As some of you might have noticed, Hugo Santos, one of our student candidates, couldn't wait anymore and already started improving our network stack. Recently, he fixed a bug in our UDP protocol module which prevented the NFS module from functioning reliably. In the screenshot you can see Haiku playing an MP3 file over NFS.</p>        </div>
