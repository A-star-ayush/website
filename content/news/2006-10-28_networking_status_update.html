                    <p>Work on the networking stack is making slow but steady progress. UDP and IPv4 protocols are mostly done, TCP can send out data, but receiving is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>Current work is concentrating on getting TCP ready, and to implement a network server. This server is responsible for configuring the stack when it&#39;s started, and to take over inetd services and similar things that can or even should live in userland. </p>

<p>Once the foundation is done, we&#39;re moving on to fill in some holes, like an UI for configuring the stack, and porting our existing PPP solution to the new stack. We hope  to have something usable by the end of the year. </p>
