<p>
For this year's Google Summer of Code&trade; program, we at Haiku have been allocated seven students!
Initially, we were allocated six students, but through a combination of good fortune and due diligence of our administrator Matthew Madia, an extra slot was allocated in the final days! In 2010, 367 mentoring orgs applied and there were 5539 proposals submitted by students. 
Of those, Haiku is one of <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010">152 accepted organizations</a>
and had 26 submitted proposals.

As with last year, students applying to Haiku were encouraged to submit a code contribution.
Due to a small number of "(easy)" tickets, we had initial concern how things would pan out.
So, it was decided to amend the student's page with tips on how to impress us
and a good number of students rose to the occasion.
The impact of those amendments can be seen through the various mailing list threads
from potential students and 
<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/search?q=gsoc2010&noquickjump=1&ticket=on&changeset=on">new patches for 15 tickets</a>
that relate to their proposals,
with the majority having been landed in the repository.
In addition to these visible effects, there was a higher ratio in quality submissions.
</p>
<p>
Between having fewer slots than exceptional students and some direct competition amongst the students themselves,
our selection process was exceedingly difficult.
File systems enhancements and the Services Kit saw the fiercest competition.
As one can imagine, there are several students that we are unable to mentor due to limitations in available slots & mentors. Without further ado, here's the accepted students ...

<p>
With the <a href="/news/2010-03-22_haiku_inc_contractors_haiku_code_drive_and_available_funds">recent alterations to Haiku Code Drive</a>, 
the emphasis of the program has been placed on providing established students (and other project members) the opportunity to receive
income while developing open source code for Haiku. However, we would like to take this time to honor some of the exceptional students
we would have loved to sponsor, had the additional capacity been available.
