                    <p>We are very pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.access-company.com" rel="nofollow">ACCESS Co. Ltd.</a>, the current holders of the BeOS intellectual property, has responded positively to our request for permission to reproduce the BeBook and all the Be Newsletters. As a result, we will be able to release these BeOS legacy documents under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>"ACCESS is very pleased to be able to support the Haiku project by making these documents more widely available to interested developers," comments David "Lefty" Schlesinger, Director of Open Source Technologies at ACCESS Co. Ltd. "We have a long-standing commitment to be good open source community citizens and making these documents available is an expression of that commitment," concludes David.</p>
<p>Since Haiku is an emerging OS platform, reference technical documentation is still hard to come by. The availability of these legacy BeOS documents adds to the useful bibliography that prospective Haiku developers can consult to familiarize themselves with development for our platform. Both the BeBook and the Be Newsletters will be made available at haiku-os.org, and will be directly searchable from our website.</p>
<p>We take the opportunity to express our gratitude to ACCESS Co. for responding to our request, and to David in particular for taking the time to make this happen. ACCESS Co. Ldt. is a global provider of advanced software technologies to the mobile and beyond-PC markets.
