<p>Due to the immediate testing efforts of HAIKU Release 1 Alpha 4, several critical bugs were detected by testers and reported on our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org">bug tracker</a>. On several hardware configurations, those issues prevented Haiku from booting properly. Since then, those bugs have been squashed and are resolved in this bugfix update, R1 Alpha 4.1. </p>

<p>There are two general issues fixed by this point release:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Deskbar can freeze at boot-up on read-only media.</b><br/>
   <b>Issue:</b> Potential kernel level deadlocking issue in the network stack.<br/>
   <b>Solution:</b> The cause of the deadlock was found and corrected.<br/>
   <b>Change:</b> <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?h=r1alpha4&id=01808ce93907b86718c6293744125682998fbccb" target="_blank">hrevr1alpha4-44701</a></li>

<li><b>Users can see a kernel crash at boot-up on read-only media.</b><br/>
   <b>Issue:</b> Normalization never occurring on module image paths due to a bug in the hash table.<br/>
   <b>Solution:</b> Hash table code was fixed preventing duplicate module images from loading.<br/>
   <b>Change:</b> <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?h=r1alpha4&id=2acdce3560cb73cfb87c0680319511c67f809561" target="_blank">hrevr1alpha4-44700</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We have replaced the R1A4 files on the website with R1A4.1 files to ensure these issues are thoroughly corrected. The archives are named "haiku-r1alpha4.1-*" and the image files contained within retain the "haiku-r1alpha4*" nomenclature. </p>

<p>If you have already installed R1A4, we recommend updating to R1A4.1. Thank you all for testing and supporting Haiku!</p>
