The Haiku Project is excited to announce the availability 
of our third official alpha release. A year and a month have passed since 
the Alpha 2 and the Haiku Project has been busy. The main purpose of this 
release is to provide interested third party developers with a stable version 
for testing and development. To aid with that, Haiku includes a rich set of 
development tools.

<h3>About Haiku</h3>
<p>
	The Haiku Project is a volunteer based initiative and was started on August 
	18th, 2001. The goal of the project is to develop and promote the adoption of 
	Haiku, an open source, general purpose operating system. Haiku aims at personal
	computing, letting you do what you want with ease! Haiku adopts design concepts
	from the BeOS&reg; and takes it to the next level by infusing those concepts with 
	recent advances.
