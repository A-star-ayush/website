<p>
That's right, you read that right. And no, today is not April 1st.
<a href="http://www.haikuware.com">Haikuware</a>
has donated Ten-Thousand Dollars to Haiku, Inc.
</p>

<p>
Haiku, Inc. gratefully values each and every dollar that is is donated.
A contribution of this magnitude, well, it simply is astounding.
<b>In other words, thank you once again, Haikuware!</b>
</p>

<p>
This financial contribution will be used to guarantee that funds for the
first six months of 
<a href="/news/2011-06-29_time_now_michael_lotz_long_term_contract">Michael's contract</a>
are 100% secured. Additionally, it will provide a significant head start
on being able to renew the contract for 6 more months.
</p>

<p>
Here's a breakdown of Haiku, Inc.'s finances.
(The numbers are rounded for presentation)
</p>
<ul>

	<li>$25,000 in available funds.</li>
	<li><i>plus</i> $4,000 from Google Summer of Code 2011</li>
	<li><i>minus</i> $3,000 for Ingo's contract</li>
	<li><i>minus</i> $16,500 for Michael's first 6 months</li>
 	<li>= $9,500 available cash, after the above transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>
In order to finance a second 6-month contract, $8,000 is the absolute
rock-bottom, bare-bones, minimum that needs to be raised. However, raising
another $10,000 will provide a small cushion to account for unexpected costs.
</p>

<p>
If need be, a specific fundraiser could be held halfway through Michael's first contract.
</p>

<p><strong>The gears are now in motion. Can you <a href="http://www.haiku-inc.org/donations.html">provide the traction</a> to keep this moving forward?</strong></p>
