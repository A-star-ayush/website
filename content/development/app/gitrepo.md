   <h4>What is Git?</h4>
		<p>Git is a powerful little tool that lets you store code on a host and then upload edits as they are completed. This makes is much easier for teams to work together on a signal project since Git does the hard work of keeping everyone's local copy to date and merging in changes. For more information on how Git works and how to use it <a href="/URLToGitGuide" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

		<p>The biggest barrier to using Git for your project is finding a host. You can either host a Git server on your own hardware or have a company manage it for you. Thankfully there are many great paid and free options for both local and cloud hosting. Below is a list that should help you find a great host for your project.</p>

		<h4>Commonly Used Git Hosts:</h4>
		<small>(All listed hosts have at least one free package and a built in web UI for repo management, issue tracking, and code review.)</small>
