Yesterday, The Lunduke Hour, hosted by Bryan Lunduke (perhaps most famous for his "Linux Sucks" presentations), had me on as a guest to talk about the state of Haiku and where we go from here:

Bryan's been a longtime fan of Haiku (some of the old-timers might remember when he reviewed R1a3 on the Linux Action Show...), and it was a lot of fun to chat with him for an hour about what's been going on over the past few years, and where things are headed.
