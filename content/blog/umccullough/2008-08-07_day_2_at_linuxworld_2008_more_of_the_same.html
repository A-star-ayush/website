<h3>Back to the Moscone Center</h3>

We cruised by my company's corporate headquarters to pick up a package I was expecting, and then went directly to the Moscone Center from there.</p>

<p>Before the conference was under way, we re-arranged the layout in the booth a little bit, putting Art and the ReactOS machine up in front next to ours a bit more. We felt this might increase the ReactOS-related questions and demos a bit, and I believe it did help. I should note that without Art Yerkes and <a href="http://www.reactos.org">ReactOS</a>, the event wouldn't have been possible for us this year.</p>

<h3>Interest still strong</h3>
<p>Today was similar to the first day, but the clumps of visitors were less, and we had more focused and genuinely interested visitors. We did get the usual: "Is this another Linux distro?" questions, but we also got several: "Wow, you re-created BeOS? That is awesome!"</p>

At least, this is what we'd like to believe, but perhaps he actually did want to visit a few other booths as well. In any case, he posed for a picture in front of the booth, and laughed when we told him it would probably show up on the website. (I don't think he believed we were serious)</p>

<h3>Into the belly of the beast</h3>
<p>With the addition of Scott, I was given a chance to finally walk through the floor and see what the other exhibits looked like. There was a Linux "<a href="http://linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/ehall//SN264817">InstallFest</a>" sponsored by Untangle. I briefly considered taking a USB stick loaded with Haiku over there and installing it on a couple machines, but due to lack of time (and courage), I didn't get a chance to do this. Perhaps tomorrow ;) There was an abundance of server and hardware products using Linux on the exhibit floor, and it was clear that Linux on desktops was not a major focus for the event at this point.<p>

<p>All in all, the day was pretty solid. I have begun to lose my voice, unfortunately - mostly due to a recent cold I have been fighting I suspect, but also due to the massive amount of talking I have been doing over the last couple of days. Hopefully it will improve overnight and I will sustain another day.</p>

<p>Day 3 report will likely be delayed as I will not have the opportunity to write anything up tomorrow night.</p>
