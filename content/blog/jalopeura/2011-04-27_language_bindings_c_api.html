<p>My project will expose the Haiku API to scripting languages. During GSoC, I will focus on enabling the creation of GUI apps; this will include large parts of the Interface Kit and some essential classes from the Application Kit. I will target Perl and Python as the scripting languages.</p>

<p>(After GSoC, I would like to support other languages as well, and increase the number of classes available from scripting languages.)</p>

<p>A timeline is available by following this <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/jalopeura/1">link</a>.</p>

<p>During the bonding period, I will be looking at the Python API, with a view to developing a generator to create the code for these extensions from an abstraction language, as an alternative to using SWIG. (I will not make a final decision on whether to use SWIG until I have determined whether it is feasible to use a custom-built generator within the GSoC time frame.)</p>
