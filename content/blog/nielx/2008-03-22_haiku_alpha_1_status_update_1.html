<p>
	This is the first Haiku alpha 1 status update. The goal of this status update is to
	provide information on how the project is going. There has recently been an consensus
	that it was about time to start preparing a first alpha for a myriad of reasons.
	To me personally, the fact that it is about time to show off the enormous amount
	of work that has been put in the project the past number of years. Another good
	reason - in my opinion - is to get everyone behind one goal: preparing the code
	for a first release.
</p>

<p>
	So what's the goal of this status update? Well, with a large number
	of developers actually working on the different components of the operating
	system, it is easy to lose track of what is going on. You can consider this
	a news update.

<p>
	Finally, I cannot guarantee that there will be regular updates, or whether
	there will be an update at all, but feel free to encourage me!

<h3><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1268">#1268 (closed)</a> - Live CD support in the build script.</h3>

<p>
	A much requested feature was to be able to boot Haiku from a CD. This also was one of
	the requirements for a working alpha release: it should be distributable by CD. Once
	upon a time there were a set of scripts on <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/4378">
	BeBits</a> that would generate a CD image. Unfortunately these scripts stopped working
	- for a long time actually - and another solution had to be found.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, Fran√ßois Revol took the task upon him. He first created a rule that made a boot
	floppy. This actually has been a request for a while, and it was implemented in
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/changeset/24198">revision 24198</a>. You can use
	<code>jam haiku-boot-floppy</code> to create a boot floppy. From there he continued
	integrating CD support. The only new external dependency is <code>mkisofs</code> which
	almost all modern Linux distributions have packages for. To actually create the necessary
	files for burning on CD, use the <code>jam haiku-cd-image</code> command. For exact
	instructions, I would like to refer you to the 
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/browser/haiku/trunk/ReadMe">ReadMe</a> that is
	distributed with the source.
</p>

<p>
	Now it is good to understand that this will boot Haiku from a CD, but there are a few
	issues. First of all, it is not very small. Some tricks have been applied (like changing
	the default block size of the disks), but it still needs work. Also, the CD is not a
	live CD like we might know from Linux distributions. These apply a trick that uses the
	RAM to emulate write support to the hard disk. The Haiku 'Live CD' does not do that. Because
	it has been untested for so long, applications or system services that depend on writing
	to the disk (which is usually the hard drive), might not be able to perform certain
	operations or just downright crash. Finally, there has been a report of the boot CD not
	being able to actually find the Haiku image on that CD. If you experience this problem,
	please see if it is similar to <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1364">ticket 1364</a>.
</p>

<p>
	On a final note, I would urge everyone with a spare CD-R (or CD-RW) and a computer that
	is known to boot Haiku on real hardware, to try to build the CD source and test the CD to
	see where it breaks.

<h3><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1739">#1739</a> - Generate a proper 'develop' directory</h3>

<p>
	One of the other major requirements was that there was a way to 'self-host'. Strictly,
	this means that it should be able to check out the source from the subversion repository,
	and to be able to compile Haiku from within Haiku. Michael Lotz had been working on a new
	heap implementation (a part of the memory manager of the kernel), which he finished in
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/changeset/23939">revision 23939</a>. After that, it was
	reported that it was possible to perform these steps (though it did not work all at one
	go).
</p>

<p>
	That was the strict definition. However, to be able to use Haiku on a more regular
	basis as a development platform, it needs to be easily possible to get gcc and the
	binutils, as well as the system headers and the libraries. In
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/changeset/23895">revision 23895</a>, Ingo Weinhold
	began implementing a 'Development' package, which allows the build system to copy all
	the headers and libraries that are needed to compile on Haiku. That was a good first
	step.
</p>

<p>
	Currently, Ingo is working on porting gcc and the binutils to Haiku, and he wants to
	have these available as an optional package which can be automatically installed by
	the build system, so that a fresh Haiku installation can be used to compile Haiku
	easily. As for such, there is a special note: the current <code>buildutils/trunk</code>
	is under development, and a fresh checkout might not work. It has already been
	reported that it does not work on <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1952">Linux
	PPC</a>. Ingo advised to use revision 24507 (<code>svn up -r24507</code>) if you want
	to build the legacy tools (gcc 2.95.3) for now.

<h3>Trac Milestone statistics</h3>

<p>
	To get the most recent statistics, go to the 
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/milestone/R1/alpha1">alpha 1 milestone page</a>. 
	To keep a clear overview of which tickets need to be fixed before releasing 
	Haiku alpha 1, the following rules apply:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Tickets that absolutely have to be resolved before alpha 1 can be
		released, should have a <strong>blocker</strong> priority.
	</li>
	<li>
		Tickets that would be on the should-be-fixed list, should have the
		<strong>high</strong> priority.
	</li>
	<li>
		In between is the <strong>critical</strong> priority. When a ticket that is 
		assigned to this milestone has this priority, it is a request for a fellow 
		developer to have a look at that ticket and determine whether it should be 
		<strong>high</strong> or <strong>blocker</strong>.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are currently <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=blocker&milestone=R1%2Falpha1&order=priority">six
	blockers</a> nominated for the alpha 1 release,
	<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=critical&milestone=R1%2Falpha1&order=priority">four 
	critical</a> and <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=high&milestone=R1%2Falpha1&order=priority">six
		high</a> open tickets.
