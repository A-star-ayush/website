I have chosen to take up Bruno Albuquerque's suggestion of porting the reference compiler and runtime of <a href="http://golang.org/">the Go programming language</a> to Haiku.
<!--break-->
<br>
Go is a simple language designed for ease of development, concurrency, and cross platform support, and because of these attributes, a Haiku port will be helpful both for porting existing Go applications to Haiku and for development of new programs.
<br>
The short term goal of the project is to be able to write simple command line programs using the Go language. The long term goal for the port is to have a base to bootstrap ports of future versions of Go (which will have parts written in Go itself and would require an existing Go runtime).
<br>
During community bonding period (April 21), I will build and test <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.haiku.ports.devel/1777/">Bruno Albuquerque's toolchain</a> from the mailing list, research Haiku's syscall interface and conventions, and examine the Golang port to Solaris as a reference point.
