<p>There have been quite a few comments on people being excited about when these start addressing the Haiku API, so I'm going to speed things up a bit. I originally planned on calling this week a Buy One, Get One Free week, but that won't fit now. Why? I had planned on publishing review questions after Lesson #5, but I must have forgotten to upload them, so I'm making them available along with Lessons 8 and 9 and the questions for review after Lesson 9 has been completed. Here they are in order. Enjoy!</p>
