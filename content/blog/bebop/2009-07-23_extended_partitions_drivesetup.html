So I started working on getting extended partition support in DriveSetup. This has been an interesting task as the extended partition support is not nearly as complete as primary partition support. To make a long story short, I have been able to create an extended partition and logical partitions within. This code is just a hack at the moment and not fit for the public but hopefully in the coming days the code can be cleaned up and the bugs can be fixed and we will have extended partitions! For those of you who are like me and enjoy seeing pictures here is a screen shot.

Ciao,

Bryce
