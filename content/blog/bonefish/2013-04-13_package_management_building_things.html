<p>It's been almost three weeks since the previous blog post and some people start wondering what the current status
is and what were working on exactly, so it's time for an update. Incidentally the time is perfect for an
update anyway, since we've just reached our first important milestone: haikuporter supports hierarchical
building of packages.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Given a package name, it can now analyze the HaikuPorts tree containing all the build recipes, recursively
determine which other packages are required for building the package and build everything that's needed in the
correct order. Each package is built in a clean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot</a>,
meaning an environment in which only the packages are installed that have explicitly been declared a build
requirement for the package in question in its build recipe. This way we make it significantly less likely
that the package we build doesn't declare a requirement to another package that it actually has, which would
potentially break things when installing it later.</p>

<p>I already wrote in the previous blog entry how we planned to reach the current goal. With a few exceptions we
followed that plan. haikuporter is still written in Python, though, since unlike we feared there weren't a lot
of problems with Python in the chroot environments. So far we don't have any translation tool from
Gentoo-Portage EBuild files to our build recipes. In the long run it might be a good idea, but the number of
packages we're currently interested in (i.e. the one needed for a regular Haiku release build) isn't that
great (less than 50), so it isn't worth the work ATM.</p>

<p>While Oliver has done all the work on haikuporter and the required build recipe changes, I worked, as planned,
on libsolv -- it has been updated to the current state of development and its Haiku port has been brought to
a working state -- implemented dependency solving support in the package kit -- a few things are still missing
but it is not far from completion now -- and added a "resolve-dependencies" command in our "pkgman" tool. This
command is used by haikuporter to resolve the dependencies between the packages that can be built and to
determine what exactly needs to be installed in the chroot for building a certain package.</p>

<p>Save for fixing a few packagefs and bindfs bugs that was all I needed to contribute to the current milestone,
so I was free to work on a few other things as well. Most importantly I started working on the package daemon,
a component of our system design that was entirely missing yet. Essentially it provides the central service
for managing the actually activated packages. It monitors the packages directories of all installation
locations and activates packages dropped there by the user and deactivates packages the user removes. That
functionality was previously implemented in packagefs. The package daemon will, however, also check whether
all requirements of new packages are fullfilled and, if necessary alert the user when there are conflicts or
additional packages (e.g. required libraries) have to be installed. This part hasn't been implemented yet,
though when started the daemon does already verify whether the currently activated package sets are
consistent.</p>

<p>The package daemon will also perform the activation and deactivation of packages as requested by the package
manager ("pkgman" and later also the GUI application) via package kit classes. That's something I've already
started working on. I've also started with an "install" command in "pkgman". Given a set of package names to
install, it already resolves the dependencies from the configured repositories. Missing yet is the actual downloading of the packages and
telling the package daemon to activate them. Once "install" is done, "remove" and "update" shouldn't be that
much work anymore, since although outcome is different, the steps to perform are very similar (resolve
dependencies, download new packages (if any), tell the daemon what to de-/activate). Once those are done the
basic "run-time" package management functionality would be usable, i.e. one could manage software repositories
and install, remove, and update packages.</p>

<p>There's plenty of other work left to do, though. Our next milestone is updating the package management branch
to the current state of Haiku development. ATM our branch is still based off a two years old Haiku. Since a
lot of ported software has been updated in the meantime, we first need to build packages for those new
versions, which in turn require us to create working build recipes for them. That's something Oliver is going
to work on next.</p>

<p>Our main focus for the remainder of our contracts is to get package management to a point where we can merge
the branch back into the main development line. We definitely won't be able to complete every aspect of
package management in the remaining time, but getting the basic functionality on top of solid foundations done
and having it in the main repository will hopefully encourage other developers to help out filling the gaps.</p>

<p>So what's the foundation work we'd like to get done?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the package building side there are some more features
needed in haikuporter, like building multiple packages from a single recipe (e.g. a base, a development, a
debug info, ... package) and building complete repositories.</p></li>

<li><p>The whole repository infrastructure area needs
some serious thoughts (we've only done some brainstorming so far) plus tool support.</p></li>

<li><p>The gcc2/gcc4 hybrid support needs to be added back to the build system. It has to work differently from how
it worked before, so it had been removed two years ago to not get in the way. There are also a few other
build system issues that need to be addressed (like mimesetting files before packaging them).</p></li>

<li><p>We have several changes to the package format on our TODO list. It might be a good idea to address those
before "going live". On the other hand that could be done later (bump the format version, keep support for the
old version around for a while), although that adds some work overhead at that time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, an update to the link list from my previous post: We have cleaned up and consolidated our GitHub
repositories. Now, owned by the "Haiku" organization, there are a <a href="https://github.com/haiku/HaikuPM">HaikuPM</a> and a
<a href="https://github.com/haiku/BuildtoolsPM">BuildtoolsPM</a> repository in which both Oliver and I are working.</p>
