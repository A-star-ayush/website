<p>
  The coding period of the Google Summer of Code is now over since this Monday,
and it's time to give to the Haiku Community a debrief of what has been done on 
my initial project, what has been modified, and what remains to do.

<h4>The Kit.</h4>

<p>
  First of all, let's talk about the good news. Among others things, I introduced
most of the classes required to make HTTP requests over the network, just like the 
cURL library allows you to do.
  The Services Kit should be viewed just like an onion : the core of the kit is
mainly responsible of managing the various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, LDAP, ..).
</p>

<p>
  In its simplest shape, the kit takes an URL, decide what protocol he should 
instantiate, make the request to retrieve a resource, ensure that the request
is well completed and return an object containing all the resulting data. 
  Advanced uses of the kit includes many protocol-defined options that can be
sent to the protocol class to refine some of its behavior. For example, one can
tell the HTTP protocol to follow every redirection it will encounter (which is
the classic behavior of a browser), specify to store cookies or not, add an form
which will be sent among the request, ...
<p>

<p>
  I wanted to be sure that at least the most important protocol was implemented,
and here it is : the HTTP protocol is <em>almost</em> fully handled in Services Kit.
 In fact, the only missing thing is a proxy manager, which is not introduced yet
in the kit. The actually implemented features in the HTTP protocol are :
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP/1.1 requests as well as old HTTP/1.0 if the user wants it.</li>
		<li>GET/HEAD/POST/PUT requests</li>
		<li>Raw POST data upload (for basic forms)</li>
		<li>Multipart MIME POST data upload (for complex forms with <b>file upload</b>)</li>
		<li>Chunked file uploads, allowing to upload a memory buffer just like it was a file and
		without knowing its size by advance.</li>
		<li>HTTP authentication (basic and digest)</li>
		<li>Optionally following redirection, with a max amount of redirections</li>
		<li>Custom headers (in order to add and/or modify those who were generated by the kit)</li>
		<li>Custom referer</li>
		<li>Custom user-agent string</li>
		<li>Full cookie management</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to Stephan, my mentor, and his remarks, the cookie management classes has
been refactored in order to have several performance improvements. They are now
much more efficient (at least a 60% gain when working on <em>big</em> cookie database)
than before when looking for the cookies of a specific domain thanks to a hash-map 
based storage.
</p>

<p>
  Every protocol request lives in a separate thread from the main application,
thus an app can do his own stuff until the request ends. The kit offers a few ways
to send notifications to the application.
  The first one is to subclass a BUrlProtocolListener, register it as the protocol
hook class, and it will receive various synchronous notifications coming from the 
protocol :
	<ul>
		<li><strong>ConnectionOpened()</strong>, when the network socket is ready</li>
		<li><strong>HostnameResolved()</strong>, when the remote host name has been resolved</li>
		<li><strong>ResponseStarted()</strong>, when the remote host begins to respond to our request</li>
		<li><strong>HeadersReceived()</strong>, when metadata are received (like HTTP headers)</li>
		<li><strong>DataReceived()</strong>, when raw data is received</li>
		<li><strong>DownloadProgress()</strong>, periodically instructs the listener on the download state (number of bytes received and number of expected bytes)</li>
		<li><strong>UploadProgress()</strong>, periodically instructs the listener on the upload state</li>
		<li><strong>RequestCompleted()</strong>, when the request ends successfully or fails</li>
	<ul>
</p>

<p>
  An application can also be asynchronously notified of the protocol behavior directly
by registering a BHandler which will received the same messages as above, but through
the messaging system. Eventually, one can decided to make a synchronous request by
using a dedicated wrapper including the url request, and the listener, which will wait
until the request ends.
</p>



<h4>Webkit and WebPositive</h4>

<p>
  An other aspect of the second half of the summer of code has been the integration
of the Services Kit within the WebKit port of Haiku, and WebPositive. This proposal 
was issued by my mentor in order to see how the kit would fit in a real application.
 Crawling through the WebKit code base was quite painful since compiling a full
debug version of the required webkit libraries takes about two hours and half on
my development machine.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, and after a lot of bug fixes :-), I have come to a well working
WebPositive no longer lying on cURL libraries, and using only Services Kit! There
is good news and bad news.
</p>

<p>
  Let's begin by the bad one : even if it works, it's still limited by Services
Kit features, and WebPositive can only access pages over HTTP. That is to say no
webmail at the moment, since almost all of them uses secure SSL connections with
HTTPS.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, Services Kit seems faster than the cURL backend. A little test
of a huge file download over my local network led me to this conclusion : Web+ with
cURL was downloading at ~250kB/s whereas Web+ with Services Kit was around 1.5MB/s.
  The core of the Kit is not yet optimized with deferred loading and other
features like that, but we could expect much more good things !
</p>



<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>
  I'm not letting Services Kit orphan at the end of GSoC and I will continue
the development of the kit. Many things are yet to be done and I'm currently moving
away the HTTP protocol from the kit in order to make an add-on for each protocol.
Such a mechanism will allow much more protocols to be handled by Services Kit, but
leds to many refactoring in the actual code in order to have a clean implementation
of these add-ons, of optional protocol features, and so on.
