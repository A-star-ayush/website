The <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/' target='_blank'>Mozilla Foundation</a> has generously donated <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/files/IMG_20140611_112739552_HDR.jpg" target="_BLANK">15 gently used Intel Mac Minis</a> to Haiku, Inc. to be used as infrastructure, development, and build systems.<br/><br/>

These systems are planned to be deployed as updated buildbot slaves, package builders, and used to better support Intel Mac Mini hardware.
