Also known as OSCON 2009, this conference will be held at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=San+Jose+McEnery+Convention+Center+150+West+San+Carlos+St.+San+Jose,+CA+95113&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&ei=798eSvLcHZDutQO8nNCNCQ&cid=13182842493957755197&li=lmd&iwloc=A&ll=37.33276,-121.889536&spn=0.006295,0.006295&source=embed" title="San Jose McEnery Convention Center Google map">Google map</a>) from July 20th through the 24th. Haiku will be exhibiting along many other Open Source orgs on July 22 and 23; our booth number is 14; to locate us in the exhibit hall, check out the <a href="/files/oscon-2009_floor-plan.pdf" title="OSCON 2009 floor plan">floor plan</a> (138KB PDF).</p>

<p>During the two days of the OSCON exhibits, Scott McCreary, Urias McCullough, and myself plan to demo the latest nightly builds of Haiku, introduce newcomers to our project and operating system, and <strike>ask</strike> answer (duh!) any questions that visitors may have about Haiku. For demo purposes, we have prepared a cube-style desktop PC that will be hooked to a projector (<a href="/files/screenshots/2009-02-21_haiku-booth-at-scale.png" rel="lightbox">similar setup from the SCaLE 2009 conference</a>), an Acer Aspire One netbook and a possible an additional laptop computer. We will also have Haiku flyers at hand.</p>

<p>Additionally, Urias has installed Haiku on a good number of USB thumbdrives that we will use to test Haiku on various hardware that may be available at other booths or that visitors may bring to our booth, and to give out as incentives to those who make donations to the project. Haiku has made great strides in terms of completeness and stability, so we are confident that we can show our OS in a very favorable light. Of particular interest is the work that has recently gone into the video playback area of Haiku, which allows to play many more file formats and much more smoothly than before. With these recent improvements, the Haiku MediaPlayer is starting to really shine. :)</p>

<p>If all of the above is not enough incentive for you to show up at OSCON, you should then know that there is a reception that will be held at the exhibit hall on Wednesday 22, from 6:00PM through 7:00PM, where apparently drinks will be served. Our booth is right by the lounge, so you know what that means. ;)</p>

<p>Whether it's for the bytes or the booze, if you plan to attend OSCON this year, please do stop by our booth and let us show and tell you the latest and hottest about Haiku. And if you are a Haiku fan in the San Francisco Bay Area or its vicinities, don't be shy and come hang out with us at the Haiku booth. We always have a lot of fun!</p>

<p>Hopefully we'll be able to post a report or two and some photos during or after the conference. Stay tuned!</p>
