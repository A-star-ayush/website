<p>Today I finished making all the changes that had to be made after dropping the Drupal authorship.module; it was much more work than expected (I should have known), as all the articles belonging to authors that did not have an account had to be edited one by one. Well, it's done now, so all there is left before we can finally do the migrations is creating two pages: Contributing Content and Spreading the Word.</p>

<p>Daytime job should not be as busy tomorrow, so I should be able to finish everything before the end of the day. Hopefully, we can have the new website live on the weekend.</p>
