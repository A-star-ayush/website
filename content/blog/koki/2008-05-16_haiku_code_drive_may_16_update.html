<p>It's been approximately 24 hours since we started the <a href="/community/haiku-code-drive-2008">Haiku Code Drive 2008</a>, so I thought I would give a quick update on where we stand right now, and also take the opportunity to share with you a few observations based on some of the feedback that we have received so far. I want to start by saying that the response so far from the community has been great. We are exploring somewhat unknown waters with the Haiku Code Drive, so there was a degree of uncertainty as to how the community would respond. This is why it is so rewarding to see the great outpour of generous donations that we have already received in just one day. Contributions are coming in from all over, including Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, the US and many other countries. We have started a <a href="/community/haiku-code-drive-2008/donate#donors">list of donors</a> in the donation page, so check it out (to be updated daily).</p>

<p>I am keeping an eye on the contributions, and as I write this I can see we are already at about half of what we need to sponsor one student; we are currently at approximately $1,300.00, but the total changes so fast, that it is hard to keep up! This is absolutely awesome, but it's only the beginning. Remember, this is your program: you fund it, you choose who to sponsor. If you have not yet made your pledge to the cause, please <a href="/community/haiku-code-drive-2008/donate">head over to the donation page</a> and show us your love for Haiku. This is your opportunity to make a difference, so don't miss it! :)</p>

<p>This is the first time we try this sort of program, and we are sure there will be lessons to learn from this first experience. We are already aware of some areas where we can improve. For example, PayPal may not be that convenient for people in some countries, nor it is the most economical way to receive donations; hopefully next year we will be in a position to offer other alternatives, both for the added convenience to the donors, as well as for the potential savings on transaction fees. Also, this year we specifically targeted GSoC students, but next year may be different, and we may consider opening up the program to broader participation. Perhaps we will also carry out the program at a different time of the year, so that it does not overlap with the GSoC, which can be a bit overwhelming from an organizational and mentoring point of view. I am sure we will find other areas where we could have done better as we go along or people point out; we will try to learn from this experience in order to make a better Haiku Code Drive next year.</p>

<p>Besides the many generous donors, we also want to thank those who are helping to spread the word about the Haiku Code Drive 2008, including but not limited to <a href="http://www.haikunews.org">Haiku News</a>, <a href="http://haikuware.com">Haikuware</a>, and <a href="http://beosnews.com">BeOS News</a>.

<p>Will be back with another update in a few days!</p>
