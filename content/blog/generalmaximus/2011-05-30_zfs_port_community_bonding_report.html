<p>I was busy with finals throughout the Community Bonding period, which left me with little time to work on GSoC-related tasks. I still have 3 exams left with the last one being on June 7. That's when the fun starts. For now I'm merely playing with ZFS on FreeBSD on a virtual machine. I still need to make my way through at least the <i>ZFS On-Disk Specification</i>. Even though the information contained in this document is not strictly required for porting ZFS to Haiku, it's a useful read nonetheless. It also makes me look like a rockstar when I open it in coffee shops.</p>

<p>According to my proposal, this is what comes next:
  <ul>
    <li>Finish porting dependencies (libavl, libnvpair, libuutil, libumem).</li>
    <li>Begin writing an OpenSolaris compatibility layer. This involves studying how threads, mutexes, condition variables etc. work on Solaris and then writing wrappers that behave in a similar manner around the Haiku API.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>This means approximately one week spent on porting and testing dependencies and a fair bit of time spent on learning about low-level Solaris interfaces. One week is an optimistic estimation for a port of any kind, but some of the dependencies are merely libraries that implement useful data structures. This means they might build on Haiku without major changes. I can't say anything further unless I've taken a better look at them myself. The end result of the quarter term should be an OptionalPackage that contains all the external ZFS dependencies.</p>

<p>June 7 is not far :)</p>
