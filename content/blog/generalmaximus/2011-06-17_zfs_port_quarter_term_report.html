<p>My quarter term goals for the ZFS port included porting all the libzpool dependencies to Haiku. Out of four major dependencies --  libavl, libnvpair, libuutil and libumem -- I already have two -- libavl and libnvpair -- building on Haiku. libumem and libuutil will take another few days, which puts me at least a week behind my original schedule.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on porting libuutil, which is presenting a few roadblocks but nothing that can't be fixed in one day's work.</p>

<p>When I have some free time, I want to take a break from working on the port and do some cleanup. So far I've indiscriminately copied all the Solaris headers I need into my own repository. This is bad. I eventually want to use as many Haiku headers as possible, only importing those definitions from Solaris that are missing from the Haiku headers.</p>

<p>After all the libraries are working, the next step is porting libzpool itself.</p>
