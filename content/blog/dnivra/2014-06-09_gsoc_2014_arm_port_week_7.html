Hey everyone!<br />
Just like week 6, this is another short update.<br /><br />

I’ve been working on creating a bootstrap-mmc target for the build system. The current issues I’m facing are<br />
<ol>
<li> Downloading MLO and u-boot fails and thus build fails since jam doesn’t know how to create those targets otherwise. I managed to fix this but apparently, the fix breaks the current build system so I need to modify the fix such that it doesn’t break the build system.</li>
<li>Copying the bootstrap image as the second partition of the MMC image. I planned to use dd since it works fine and probably works fine on Linux and BSDs but dd requires a size to be specified, which is slightly tricky to compute in jam. The obvious solution of using cat doesn’t seem to work - the resultant size of MMC is much higher than expected.</li>
</ol>
<br />
I hope to add the bootstrap-mmc target for jam within this week which would make it much easier for anyone to build the image.
