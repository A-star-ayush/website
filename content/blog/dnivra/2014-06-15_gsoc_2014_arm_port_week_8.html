Hey everyone!<br />
The bootstrap-mmc target is now finally available! What this means is that you can follow all instructions in [1]
<!--more-->
except run

<pre class="terminal">
$ jam -q @boostrap-mmc
</pre>

instead of

<pre class="terminal">
$ jam -q @bootstrap-raw
</pre>

and you’ll get an image that can be copied to an SD card directly.<br /><br />

BIG DISCLAIMER: Things are not working yet! MMU isn’t operational still and there is still a long way to go till Haiku starts working on a beaglebone black. The good news though is if you are interested in helping out, compiling Haiku for a beaglebone black just got much easier :).<br /><br />
