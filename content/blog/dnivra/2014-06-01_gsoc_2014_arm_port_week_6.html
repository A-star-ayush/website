Hey everyone!<br />
Here’s an update on week 6(a relatively short one so no TL;DR :) ).
<br /><br />
I managed to fix the bootable SD card image generation script that I created last week to use mtools and thus eliminate the need for losetup and root permissions. The script is available in a Github[1] repository
<br /><br />
Meanwhile, I’ve also been working on adding a bootstrap-mmc target to Jam. Right now, the target generates the haiku_loader_nbsd.ub successfully but fails because it doesn’t know how to generate MLO and u-boot. I have not figured out why it doesn’t know how to make targets MLO and u-boot. Hopefully, I’ll fix that up in a few days.
