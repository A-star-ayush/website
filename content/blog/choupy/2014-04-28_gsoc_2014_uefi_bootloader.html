<h2>Me, myself and I</h2>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Louis Feuvrier, I am a french student located in
Paris (GMT+2) studying computer science at EPITA. I am lucky enough to be part
of a laboratory (LSE) as my curriculum which allows me to work on interesting
and low-level problems! Here's the one that will keep me awake at night in the
following months (but hopefully not too much!)</p>

<p>Besides computer stuff, I enjoy listening to music, playing video games,
watching tv shows or going to gigs.</p>

<h2>The project proposal</h2>

<p>OK, in the end the idea is to get Haiku to be UEFI-compliant, meaning bootable
on all the x86_64 machines not providing a legacy BIOS. It also means enabling
UEFI on the other ones as well, as it provides more features regarding the boot
process via the NvRAM amongst other things.</p>

<p>There are many strategies to enable UEFI on the Haiku kernel. The first that I
proposed here[1] was resembling the one adopted by the Linux kernel (making the
bzImage an EFI application, I explain more about this here[2].) As explained in
the previously mentionned mailing list thread (here[3]), the solution is not
really appliable in Haiku's case, since the decomposition into two entities
(kernel and loader) is very advantageous.</p>

<p>The solution decided upon by everybody (as far as I know!) is to have the
stage2 (the loader, located in both src/system/boot/platform and
src/system/boot/loader as can be seen here[4]) to be the UEFI application.</p>

<p>An UEFI application is a Portable Executable, which usually resides in the UEFI
partition. The UEFI partition is often just a primary partition formated in
fat32 and containing all the UEFI applications. Once the application is placed
in this partition, it is easy to launch it via an UEFI shell or programmation
of the NvRAM.</p>

<p>This solution also enables booting via both UEFI and legacy boot at the same
time, as the user wishes. Indeed, the build could generate both the legacy boot
stage2 (a RAW image located in the Haiku partition) and an UEFI stage2 (a
Portable Executable located in the UEFI partition.) This is pretty cool in my
opinion as it does not break the original booting process.</p>

<p>At run-time, the booting process might look like this, depending on wether one
boots via the legacy boot process or via UEFI capabilities:</p>

<h2>The first step</h2>

<p>What I will proceed with right now is booting an EFI image and try to launch
the kernel with that, using the current stage2 platform-independent code and by
writing my own platform-dependent UEFI code.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, both stage2 share the same platform-independent code (the
one located in the src/system/boot/loader folder.) However, each one has its
own platform-dependent code in the src/system/boot/platform/{efi,bios_ia32}
subfolder. This gives us the following source tree:</p>

<pre>boot/
├── loader/
├── platform/
│   ├── bios_ia32
│   ├── efi
│   ├── pxe_ia32
│   ├── openfirmware
│   ...
...
</pre>

<p>If, as development advances, lots of code appears common to both the BIOS and
UEFI modules, then I might factorize the code with a x86 parent folder, as
follows:</p>

<pre>boot/
├── loader/
├── platform/
│   ├── x86/
│   │   ├── efi
│   │   ├── bios_ia32
│   │   └── pxe_ia32
│   ├── openfirmware
│   ...
...
</pre>

<p>At first, I wanted to proceed with this factorization first, but the codebase
is not trivial and I'd much prefer doing it as I go, because the tasks
currently seems really time-consuming and I am not even clear on what
platform-dependent features (drivers) I need for the UEFI implementation.</p>

<h2>Second step</h2>

<p>Once the stage2 loader is tuned finely enough for it to boot the Haiku kernel
correctly via UEFI, most of the hard work is done. But still, to get UEFI
booting going for the end user, we need configuration tools.</p>

<p>I am not sure at all on exactly what needs to be done on this matter, so I will
not expand much on it. I can however say for sure that we will need a port or a
re-write of the efibootmgr of linux, as well as a Haiku module enabling access
to the NvRAM prior to this, using the RuntimeService designed for this. Currently, linux implements it via a virtual filesystem in something like /sys/firmware/efi via the efivarfs or efivars module, depending on the version
of the kernel.</p>

<p>These seemingly trivial tasks might however take lots of time, so I need to get
going on the first step as soon as possible. I will see with the people
responsible for the package-management capabilities how to incorporate the
stage2.efi application later down the line.</p>

<h2>Community bonding period</h2>

<p>I looked for a useful task of preparation to this developement but I cannot
really find any. I know that I need to get more familiar with the build
system, but this doesn't require a month. I also need to get familiar with what
is already done in jessicah's UEFI branch and build upon that.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, my plan is to setup the build on my computer as well as
the testing facilities in order for the development to be much less painful. I
will then be able to compile and test on-the-fly, and verify as development
goes, that everything is working as expected.</p>

<p>So, to me, the development actually starts now. My main goal is to execute code
from the kernel.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am trying to be as precise as I can regarding the schedule, but it is hard to
make predictions at this point in the development. Everything will probably
change as we go, so it is pointless to setup dates and deadlines. I hope I will be able to complete the project in time, and that the result will match the hopes of the future users!</p>

<p>Thanks to you for reading and to jessicah, tqh, axeld and Ingo Weinhold for taking the time to discuss the proposal and the project with me.</p>
