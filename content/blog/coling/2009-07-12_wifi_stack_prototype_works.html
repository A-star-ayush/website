Today I fiddled out the last hurdle on getting my WiFi-card up and running. It only connects to unprotected open wireless LANs, because there is no configuring mechanism implemented yet. Though it is far away from completeness.<p>

On the screenshot, you see Firefox surfing www.haiku-os.org and downloading a 100 MiB file from my ftp server in parallel. The terminal is showing the result of the ifconfig command for my WiFi-card.<p>

I managed to port the FreeBSD WiFi-stack, utilizing Haiku's FreeBSD compatibility layer. Thus I could use the WiFi-card driver for my atheros chipset from FreeBSD without any major changes to its codebase (I had to move some interrupt handler code into driver-specific glue code). <p>

The driver-binary has a size of 500 KiB, due to compiling the WiFi-stack into a static library and statically linking it and the FreeBSD compat layer with the driver. <b>Update:</b> The sources are up in the <a href="http://dev.osdrawer.net/repositories/show/haiku-wifi">haiku-wifi repository</a> on <a href="http://www.osdrawer.net">www.osdrawer.net</a> (read "For the bravery" down the line for more info on how to get it).<p>
<!--break-->
The atheros driver should support every atheros chipset, which are supported by the FreeBSD driver (look in the corresponding FreeBSD <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ath&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+7.1-RELEASE&format=html">manpage</a> for more information on supported chipsets).<p>

Designing a Haiku specific WiFi-stack will be my next step.<p>

<b>For the brave only:</b> <i>The source can be checked out via</i> svn checkout http://svn.osdrawer.net/haiku-wifi/prototype/trunk/wifi<i>. I recommend the 3rdparty subdirectory as checkout location, because the Jamfiles expect themselves there. With</i> jam ath <i>everything needed (customized FreeBSD compat layer, WiFi stack, atheros driver) gets built.<p>
<b>Update:</b> For developing I used a gcc2 build environment and Haiku rev. 31286 was the newest I tested it on.<p>
There are no settings to set to make this driver work. Just put the driver in</i> /home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin <i>and make a symlink to</i> /home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/net/ath</i>. A reboot could be required to make Haiku recognize the new driver.<p>
To check whether your atheros card gets at least detected by this driver, watch the debug messages during the bootphase or look into the</i> /boot/var/log/syslog<i> file. If you see something like <pre>Adding entry for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet mode autoselect autoselect
Adding entry for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet mode autoselect autoselect &lt;adhoc&gt;
Adding entry for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet mode autoselect autoselect &lt;hostap&gt;
Adding entry for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet mode autoselect autoselect &lt;flag0,adhoc&gt;
Adding entry for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet mode autoselect autoselect &lt;monitor&gt;
</pre> you know that your card is detected<p>
<b>Update2:</b> To connect to a WLAN make sure that it is an unprotected (no WPE, WPA, WPA2) one that doesn't need a password for login. On my Fritz!Box this is called "unverschl√ºsselten Zugang aktivieren" (activate unencrypted access).<p>

For more information on technical aspects of the hardware I use surf to <a href="http://www.haikuware.com/wireless-network-stack-bounty">the bounty proposal on haikuware</a> and select the "Technical Information" tab.</i><p>

I will give no support for this prototype 'cuz it is a prototype ;-). It is intended for the purpose of gaining knowledge, only.
