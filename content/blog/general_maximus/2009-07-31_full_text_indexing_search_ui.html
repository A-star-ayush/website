<p>So far, I have been working on the indexing part of Beacon, which is nearly complete. In the coming weeks, I will be running beacond (now index_server) as a service in the background so that I can find and squash whatever bugs remain in the code. For now, index_server is blazing fast, but that might be because the indexes I test against are just a few megabytes in size. From what I hear, though, CLucene can easily handle indexes which are several <i>gigabytes</i> in size without blinking an eye, so speed might not be an issue as the indexes grow. Anyway, any potential performance bottlenecks will only show themselves once people start using index_server regularly.</p>

<p>And now for the good part: I have a basic search UI for Beacon up and running. For now, it can only perform simple keyword searches. In the future, I would love to integrate full text search into the Tracker "Find" UI, but for now I'm concentrating on improving this simple search tool.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot: </p>

<p><i>/Files/pg/</i> is the directory where I'm keeping about 600MB of Project Gutenberg texts for stressing out index_server.</p>

<p>The next step is, of course, writing DataTranslators for a few file formats (as I've said before, PDF is top priority) and writing a simple preferences UI. I hope to post here soon with more good news :)</p>

<p><strong>PS: </strong> Anybody interested in learning the CLucene query syntax can take a look at <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/queryparsersyntax.html">this page</a> (although, in the future, Beacon will take a BeOS query and convert it into a CLucene query transparently).</p>
