<p>A lot of things have happened since the last status update! As far as I
can tell, the kernel part of the file system resizer is mostly complete.
Some details remain, along with a healthy dose of bugs to be fixed. In
addition, I've written a 'resizefs' command for bfs_shell. Let's look at
a typical session with the mighty resizefs!</p>

<pre class="terminal">
fssh:/> resizefs 100
File system information:
        Bitmap:     1 blocks (was 1)
        Log start:  block 2 (was 2)
        Log length: 512 blocks (was 512)
        Block size: 2048 bytes

Error:  Not enough space left.
Status: Invalid argument
</pre>

File system successfully resized!

<p>Perhaps not too user friendly.</p>

<p>I will spend the following weeks testing and fixing bugs. My plan is to
use a tiny script to checksum all parts of the filesystem before and after
the resize. I will combine this with code coverage testing with gcov, and
simply create and try images and resizing sizes. Special care will also
need to be taken with the parts that modify the normal operation of the
driver.</p>

<p>With this process, I expect to find and exterminate all non-subtle bugs
hiding in seldom (or never) executed code. If anyone has any other exciting testing ideas,
I'd be happy to hear them.</p>

<p>All in all, things are moving along roughly on schedule. By the end of
this period, I'd like to have the kernel part robust and done, so I can
move on to adding support to DriveSetup and related tasks.</p>
