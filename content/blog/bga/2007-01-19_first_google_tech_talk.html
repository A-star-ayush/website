<p>Today I presented the first (out of three) Google Tech Talks scheduled for the following weeks. The reception I got from other Google engineers was really good and, more than that, they gave me lots of feedback that I will apply to the following presentations. Seeing the reactions made me reach the conclusion that we are in the right path and even when considering a highly technical audience, the simplicity we are trying to achieve with Haiku got the interest of several engineers.</p>

<p>Maybe we will be seeing new collaborators soon!</p>
