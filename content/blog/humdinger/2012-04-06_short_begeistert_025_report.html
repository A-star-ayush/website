<p>As this was one of the smallest BeGeistert meetings, this report
will be quite short as well...</p>

<p>I arrived at the airport on Saturday morning at about 9:15 and
made it to the nice location at Düsseldorf's youth hostel at 10
o'clock. After weeks with temperatures up to 20 °C, the good weather
took a day off and I made the 10 minute walk from the station
"Luegplatz" to the hostel in a very fine drizzle and shivering 10 °C...

<p>Opening the door to our conference room I was greeted by 7/10th of
our full number this time: the French delegation with Olivier, Jérôme
and Adrien; Mark with his trusty 15 year old Toshiba laptop running
BeOS and Axel who had to discover that his notebook isn't of that same
sturdy quality. Not only did his mouse die (which strangely kept working
for a while, but only when used in the middle of his <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/kb_adv-blk720x471.jpg">
freaky keyboard</a>), but apparently Ubuntu forgot to turn on the fans,
resulting in an overheat emergency shutdown...<br />
Andre, treasurer of the <a href="http://www.haiku-support-association.org/">
Haiku Support Association (HSA)</a> that sponsors and organizes
BeGeistert, was also there after having missed the last few meetings.
Unfortunately he had to leave already shortly after lunch.</p>

<p>Just before lunch came the rest of the gang: Charlie sweating
profusely after an adventurous bike ride including a chain malfunction,
and Christian and Lorenz, the <a href="http://besly.de/">BeSly</a> guys
from Hamburg.</p>

<p>While last BeGeistert (024) saw quite a few talks and demonstrations
(though a report of it all sadly failed, other than the videos on <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FFCD4C6D384A302">package
management</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC64D26826684BE49">
the move to git</a>), there was none of that this time. There's hope
that with a usually higher number of participants, this will pick up
again the next time.<br />
Instead everyone was busy hacking away on their various projects and
favorite bugs. In my case, I occasionally disturbed Axel with BFS
related KDLs which I hope helped him with the accomplished fixes.</p>

<p>At the same time of BeGeistert 025 the first "Bugfix Weekend" was
held in IRC/BeShare. I think it was pretty quiet in those channels, but
the <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/timeline?from=04%2F02%2F12&daysback=3&authors=&ticket=on&ticket_details=on&update=Update">
contributions that weekend</a> show that not only the BG coders where
busy. I just quickly asked around what the people at BeGeistert were
working on mainly:</p>

<p>Olivier took a little break from his efforts on "OpenOffice for
Kids" and spent most time on the <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">Freepascal</a>
port. Recent builds had some problems, especially concerning signal handling.
Now a few more tests pass under Haiku.</p>

<p>Jérôme added missing parts for an ARM libroot and investigated how
much of glibc is ARM-ready. Turns out it may need a new version, so a
look at other options (uClibc, newlib, eglibc) could be worthwhile. He
also fixed the es1370 audio driver build.</p>

<p>Adrien patched the USB mass storage driver to get copying files to
certain MP3 players working properly. Next were some fixes for the game
<a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/games/strategy/critical-mass-2">
Critical Mass</a> and the build of the music editor <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/multimedia/audio/synthesizer/sawteeth">
Sawteeth</a> under gcc4. Then he started work on integrating the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/game-music-emu/">
Game Music Emu (GME)</a> library into <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/multimedia/audio/playback/aplayer">APlayer</a>
to be able to play back Nintendo, Genesis, and some other chiptune file formats.</p>

<p>Axel was successfully hunting down bugs in the filesystem. One result
of his work: <tt>checkfs </tt> is now able to repair errors in b+trees
of indices. I suffered from those myself on various partitions which
resulted in visits to the Kernel Debugging Land whenever I tried to
build a Haiku image. All gone now, yay! Some of the tickets being
affected by this and other bugs in that area were <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/8408">
#8408</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/7951">#7951</a> and <a
href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/8069">#8069</a>.</p>

<p>Mark was busy improving the rendering engine of the <a href="http://themis.sf.net">
Themis</a> browser. He got the loading of images to work, but currently only for
local images (file:// protocol) using the translation kit.
Here an old problem of his ancient BeOS R5 system reared its ugly head:
crippled by patent issues, there was no GIF translator installed... He
still has to do some more testing before committing to the Themis
repository.</p>

<p>I did some small optical improvements for <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/entertainment/internet-network/ubertuber">
UberTuber</a> and tried to lend my meager C++ knowledge to Charlie, who
was determined (and with Axel's help successful in the end) to put
together a guide on creating "unit tests". Stuff for an upcoming
article.</p>

<p>Christian and Lorenz were busily coding and discussing strategies
for their <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/development/editors/yabide-besly-edition">
yabIDE</a>. All in yab of course, which recently saw a new version
released, but could do with some more programmers to speed up its
development.</p>

<p>One unusual thing did happen on Saturday evening: We got a visit
from a professional photographer. He was to take high quality pictures
from our flock of coders (and who else happens to resemble that on a
short glance... :)). They're supposed to appear in a Haiku article in
IEEE Spectrum Magazine that Ryan is preparing. Nice!<br />
While he and his assistant set up the conference room, we all went to a
nearby Spanish restaurant where we enjoyed very nice tapas, beer, wine
and what else you'd expect in such a place.</p>

</div>

<p>Two hours later we were back, sitting in the now sparsely
illuminated conference room while the photographer fired away. Now I
know how the other top models feel when they come on a set after
stuffing themselves to the brim with Spanish delicatessen...<br />
After the shoot was finished we had a look at the results on the
photographer's notebook. Pretty stunning what a 80 megapixel camera can
do in the hand of a professional.</p>

<p>Altogether we all had our fun on this BeGeistert even if we missed
all our friends that couldn't make it. There definitely was less "buzz"
in the air this time. To make the next one live up its usual glory, the
date for the next BeGeistert is already fixed, so everyone can mark
their calendar:</p>
