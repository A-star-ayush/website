<p>
'Me' and 'We'. They're the same thing, just with a slightly different way of 
looking at it. There's always something to do, some way of helping further 
the Haiku Project ... though it's not all glitz, glamor, and fame. In fact, 
a good portion is, well, it's tedious; it's boring; it's stuff we'd rather not
be doing. For a volunteer based project such as ours, that can be a death 
sentence for those tasks. So, hopefully these words will encourage you to see 
the usefulness of those tasks and enable you to find the motivation to 
contribute to them.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, it's easier to figure out what you want to be or do by crossing-off
the bits that you know that you don't want. While this doesn't outright give 
you an answer, it helps by trimming down the possibilities. This makes the list
more inviting to think about.
</p>
<p>
First, I've made amends that being a C/C++ developer will not be on my list of
abilities, at least not in the next year or two. Sure, I can fix some typos and 
make other small changes to that code. But my skills are nothing in comparison
to our past and current Google Summer of Code students, let alone any of the
other regular C/C++ contributors. And that's OK, as there's other tasks that
need to be done.
</p>
<p>
At one point the idea formed that by helping the developers with their 
non-coding tasks, they were reclaiming time and energy that could be used 
elsewhere. This is still the keystone for my motivation -- keeping the 
developers free to write code, free to do tasks that I'm not yet capable of,
free to further the Project.
</p>

<h2>Reviewing and applying patches</h2>
<p>
	This is a task that with some investment of time and energy, can
	repay itself in the form of fueling the motivation of new and
	interested developers. By helping with this, you would be 
	improving the Project's reputation of managing and accepting
	patches. In turn, this will encourage other newcomers to provide
	patches, with the reassurance that it'll be looked at and hopefully
	used.
</p>

<h2>Maintaining tickets</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Polling old tickets for a status update</li>
	<li>Asking ticket reporters to include additional relevant details</li>
	<li>Pointing out duplicate tickets</li>
</ul>
<p>		
	Our development tracker, <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org">dev.haiku-os.org</a>
	is one of the key components to the project. It informs people of problems
	and issues with the software, keeps track of what needs to be done, and many
	other things.
</p>
<p>
	These tasks help to streamline the process, allowing things to move more 
	smoothly. Even people who are not committers can receive the permissions
	to manage tickets. All that is needed is a familiarity with Trac and the
	willingness to learn some basics of the Project -- what information is
	needed for which type of bugs and which bugs belong to a certain component
	for example.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Haiku Book / Code</li>
	<li>Improving existing information</li>
	<li>Pointing out outdated/incorrect text</li>
	<li>Offering corrections</li>
	<li>Where/How to submit it? : open a new ticket on Trac or ship it to a mailing list</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here's another way of looking at writing documentation...
	Knowledge is power. Sharing that knowledge and making it easily 
	accessible empowers you, the people seeking it, and other people 
	who would normally need to spend the time to answer those questions.
</p>
<p>	
	In addition to this, since documentation is typically a weak point for
	F/OSS projects, you will help Haiku stand out as one of the groups with
	a good and useful level of documentation. 
</p>

<h2>Improving websites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Plugins for Trac</li>
	<li>PHP/JavaScript/etc...</li>
	<li>CSS tweaks</li>
	<li>Suggestions for new project controlled websites</li>
	<li>Creating themes for 3rd party sites</li>
	<li>Offering improvements for project related sites</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Websites are literally a portal for people to learn about us.
	It can be the first impression for them. For others, it's a means
	of interacting with us, to find information, to communicate.
</p>

<h2>Report issues to the developer</h2>
<p>
	...even if you heard it on IRC or a forum.
	There's two types of bugs that get fixed: ones that you make a patch for
	and ones that the developer is informed about. And let's admit it, there
	is little chance for any single person being able to test for, let alone
	find every bug in a program. This is particularly true for locking, timing,
	and other race-condition bugs as certain hardware simply won't expose it. 
</p>

<h2>Building, packaging, and testing software for Haiku</h2>
<p>
	Offering to build and package the next release of some software is a great
	way to inspire developers. It shows that there are people who use their 
	software and are looking forward to the next release. And surprisingly, 
	this can be a task that de-motivates developers. It takes time to prepare 
	an archive for distribution and ensure that it'll work on other people's 
	installations.
</p>

<h2>Expressing sincere gratitude</h2>
<p>
	It is truly amazing how even a few words can be gratifying and motivating.
	These are tokens of appreciation are truly gems and can have a lasting effect.
</p>


<h1>In closing ...</h1>
<p>
Motivation is the life-force of volunteer based efforts. Particularly ones
like ours, where there is no corporate sponsorship, no government funding,
no wealthy entrepreneur pouring funds into the project to make things happen.
Nearly every ounce of motivation comes from within. It can be as simple as 
honestly asking yourself "Do I want to help this project"? Whenever that answer 
is 'yes', a seed is planted in yourself, an opportunity for growth, a chance to
make a positive impact. What you make of that and how you shape it is within 
your own hands.
