<p>
As you may recall during August, Ingo Weinhold
and Oliver Tappe were each accepted for two-month development contracts
relating to package management[<a href="/news/2012-08-20_two_contractors_each_two_months">1</a>]. Originally, their start dates
were slated for sometime around November or December. Due to their
current contractual obligations with other employers, they will not
be able to begin as early as planned. The revised start date is now 
around February or March.
