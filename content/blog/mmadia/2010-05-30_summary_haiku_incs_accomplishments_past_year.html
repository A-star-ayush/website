<p>
Some days ago, I realized that Haiku, Inc. never gave an official
status update on its progress. Looking back at where we were last
year, a lot of progress has been made. While <strong>this is not an official
statement from the BOD</strong>, these are just my personal observations and
recollections.

</ul>

<p>
	I'm feeling really good about the TODO list too. 
	The By laws, registering the TM, and "finishing" the TM policy are still some daunting items.
</p>
<p>
	Personally, the <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/WorkInProgress/HaikuTrademarkPolicy">Work-In-Progress TM policy</a>
	is going in a good direction. Though it still has areas that need to be fleshed out, as well as review by any of you
	and the project at large. Very recently, aldeck pointed out some links, which are mentioned in <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-inc/More-TM-Policy-ideas-from-other-orgs-Ideas-on-selling-TM-goods">More-TM-Policy-ideas-from-other-orgs-Ideas-on-selling-TM-goods</a>
</p>
<p>
	In the next weeks, I'm going to be reading the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">Software Freedom Center</a>
	for some more ideas relating to the TM Policy, as well as registering it. This is something that I feel needs to be
	done in time for R1.
</p
<p>
	Hope you enjoyed the read and I'll be happy to explain any of this in more detail.
