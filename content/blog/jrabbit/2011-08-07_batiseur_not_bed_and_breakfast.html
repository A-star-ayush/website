<p>In these last few (official) weeks of Google Summer of Code I&#8217;m focusing on the meat of my project. This means that side features like the achievements, scoreboard etc will be &#8216;frozen&#8217; as-is until after GSOC. I&#8217;m planning on rounding them out, just not yet. The main work will be on the builddrone working properly and testing/signing. A major but was in the camlistore python library, I&#8217;ve fixed it and will change how it works a little. </p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jrabbit/batisseur-planning/blob/master/haikuports-cooler/validate.py">haikuports standalone validator</a> which can be used in an upcoming version of haikuports possibly or just for your own amusement on a simple bepfile. (Hint you could wrap this in a git-hook and then only allow a commit if your beps pass!) On the builddrone front I fixed a bunch of assumption-related bugs that came from not testing.</p>
