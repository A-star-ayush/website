<p><a href="https://github.com/jrabbit/batisseur-planning/commits/master">A lot of commits have happened since I last blogged on my GSOC Project.</a> The big hitters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the framework of a rankings website for users&#8217; point totals</li>
<li>A non-regex parser I wrote because I&#8217;m impatient (I&#8217;m going to test its speed.)</li>
<li>The begining of the http server that will inform user&#8217;s builddrones of availible jobs (builds) [Basically it tells you if packages have been updated so you can build them]</li>
<li>Verified that Camlistore (on python) can work on Haiku.</li>
<li>A Jenkins API wrapper for magic to happen (I think it may be the perfect thing to handle build logs and results)</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Redis</li>
</ul>

<p>Progress is coming along, I recently [On the 15th] returned from a tour of France. There is a second period later in the summer I&#8217;ll have unknown-connectivity, but I&#8217;ll still be coding then.</p>
