<p>I'm Jack (Jrabbit). I am a <a href="https://github.com/jrabbit" target="_blank">python hacker</a>. </p>

<p>BÃ¢tisseur is a broad  system for making Haiku package development simple and quick. It will borrow concepts from OpenSuse Build and Canonical's Launchpad [Specifically Soyuz].  Some documents pertaining to it can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jrabbit/batisseur-planning">this repo.</a> The end goal will be a modern build system for packages that can scale up or down and a system of achievements for participating in it.</p>

<h2>Whats happening now</h2>
<p>During the community bonding period I will be working with the new hpkg_builder tool to make sure it's ready for hackage. I will be working with the core team to look at buildbot deployment and such. Also I will be trying to get some of <a href="https://github.com/jrabbit/haiku-files-redesign">my web tools</a> I wrote for haiku put up on haiku-files.</p>
