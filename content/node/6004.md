More and more often i can't boot on my laptop, due to timeoout issues in the ahci layer :
when it tries to probe or reinit the DVD drive, some sata_request fails and i ended in KDL with the (in)famous "Panic : did not find any boot partitions" message.
There is even many tickets about that message, and some must addressing the sata_request abort problem.

I just discover that enabling the "Enable on screen debug output" and "Disable on screen paging", the sata_request never fails anymore.
Also if i put the BIOS in IDE mode, i don't get those ahci failures anymore.
I intend to build my own haiku with debug information on the ahci layer to investigate where lies the problem.
Stay tune and don't hesitate to comment !
