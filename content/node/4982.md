Thanks to everybody who has participated in the Stack & Tile web questionnaire! We have got much more participants than we had expected! So far there were 140 complete responses. I think this is great number! From these 140 participants there were 75 who had already tried S&T. It also shows that the Haiku community is not that small at all. This should be quite motivating for all developers :).

The questionnaire closes on Sun 23/11/12. So if you haven't participated yet but you are willing to fill the questionnaire please do so before this date.
