<p>This page will describe the various ways to install haiku from using a pre-built image file.  These pre-built image files are available at <a href="http://www.haiku-files.org">Haiku Build Factory</a></p>

<p>pull information from :

<p>There are three types of image files: raw, vmdk, and iso.</p>

mounting it in Haiku/BeOS/Zeta.

dd if=/path/&lt;filename&gt; of=&lt;device&gt; bs=1M

The value of &lt;device&gt; depends on your operating system.

It's like you say pretty simple, just dd the raw image to a USB drive. For Mac OS X do the following:

From http://www.nerdlogger.com/2009/05/writing-moblin-and-ubuntu-usb-images.html
1. Download the desired .img file
2. Open a Terminal (under Utilities)
3. Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices
4. Insert your flash media
5. Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2)
6. Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2)
7. Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/diskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located.
8. Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your flash media when the command completes

To be able to use your USB drive for something else use Disk Utility in the Utilities Folder. Select your drive in the sources list on the left and then select the delete tab.
