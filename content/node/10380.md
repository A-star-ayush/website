As i discovered recently, WebPositive is unable to authenticate to a Microsoft proxy, as such proxies use a proprietary protocol named NTLM. So I came to an easy solution :

<ul>
 <li>Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntlmaps/files/ntlmaps/ntlmaps-0.9.9">NTLMAPS</a> (from another computer of course) : it is a tiny Python script able to talk to a Microsoft proxy  </li>
 <li>Edit the <b>main.py</b> script to replace the string <b>/usr/bin/python</b> by <b>/bin/python</b></li> 
 <li>Configure the server.cfg file with your domain/username/password</li>
 <li>Put a link to <b>main.py</b> into <b>~/config/boot/launch</b>, so the local proxy will be run automatically at boot.
  <li>Modify the <b>~/config/settings/boot/UserSetupEnvironment</b> to add <b>http_proxy=USER:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5865</b>. If the file doesn't exist, just copy and rename the <b>UserSetupEnvironment.sample</b>. 5865 is the default port for the NTLMAPS proxy in the <b>server.cfg</b> file.</li>
<li>Reboot, or just run the <b>main.py</b> and execute the <b>UserSetupEnvironment</b> file.</li>

</ul>
