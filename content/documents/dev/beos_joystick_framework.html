                    <p>This article are more of a compliment to ITO Takayuki’s  “<a href="http://euc.jp/beos/beosjoystick.en.html" rel="nofollow">BeOS Joystick Driver</a> ” so reading ITO’s article before this one are advisable. </p>
<p>I’m not a article writing person (not even in Swedish) but as I’m the 3:d that tries to implement the Joysticks framework in Haiku I think that it would be good to have something for the 4:th person to read if I drop this :)</p>
<p>When I started to look over the Joystick framework I thought that this would not be that hard, boy was I fooled :) , lol I don’t even know how to talk to hardware. Anyway after some testing (trial and error style) I think I have found some additional information about the Joystick framework, but first I would like to describe how I think the frame work works.</p>
<p>The BJoystick class in libdevice.so talks to a joystick published at dev/joystick/”portname”/”joystick name” this way both the generic gameport and ITO’s usb_joy works as they publish as separate devices.<br />
usb_joy  = dev/joysticks/usb/0 (for the first)<br />
usb_joy  = dev/joysticks/usb/1 (Second and so on)<br />
gameport  = dev/joysticks/gameport/201<br />
etc<br />
emuxkigameport  = dev/joysticks/ emuxkigameport /et18 </p>
<p>emuxkigameport are a driver that was donated to Haiku that make’s gamport on a SB Live and Audigy soundcard work. I tried to add it to emuxki but then the sound was interfered when I moved the joystick. This driver uses the generic gameport.</p>
<p>So how does this work? You could say we have two ways of talking to Joystick’s, through usb_joy and emuxkigameport. First you must have a copy of a joystick description file in config/settings/joystick/”portname”/”joystick name”. I think that this need to be a copy of a description file as the Joystick  Preference app does changes to the file so a link are not to recommend. </p>
<p>First usb_joy, when BJoystick sends a ioct (I haven’t tested but I think I have figured that one out right?) to the driver the usb_joy does everything by itself, collecting usb information and reading  joystick description file from /settings/joystick/”portname”/”joystick name”.</p>
<p>How does the emuxkigameport  work then? BJoystick sends the same information as with usb_joy but in this case the emuxkigameport  forwared the ioct to a driver called generic gameport located under drivers/generic this one loads the file in  config/settings/joystick/”portname”/”joystick name” with this file it knows what module to load and loads this module but it must be a joystick description file in this location or you will only be allowed to used the joystick in standard mode (same if the module don’t exist to your joystick). </p>
<p>Using BeOS Joystick Framework in Haiku. Yes this works but not usb_joy as it crashes the system.<br />
You need to copy libdevice.so, Joystick preference app, etc/joysticks, media/joy, generic/gamport and Haiku’s emuxkigameport.  I have only tested stickit and BeOS R5 joystick preference and not any games.</p>
<p>So what now? I will continue but perhaps focus on the usb_joy driver and figure out what’s wrong with this driver. I would like to have some help to determent if it would be a good idée to use modules in a USB drive to handle the difference in different joystick’s or does those difference not exist in a USB world?</p>
