<div class="field field-type-text field-field-body"><h3 class="field-label">Body</h3><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>Haiku R1 (x86) was designed and is being implemented to be binary and source compatible with applications written for BeOS R5 (x86) to a large extent, but not the other way around. In some cases we deliberately broke source compatibility while at the same time maintaining binary compatibility. Here are some specific examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The "be" header path is gone - it's called "os" in Haiku; since it is always part of the default header search path anyway, you can always just
remove it to let your software compile on both platforms, ie. replace:
<pre>#include &lt;be/interface/View.h&gt;</pre> with: <pre>#include &lt;interface/View.h&gt;</pre>or rather use the preferred method of omitting the first part and use: <pre>#include &lt;View.h&gt;</pre></li>
<li>BeOS contains a deprecated <i>add-ons/TrackerAddons.h</i> header, and a header called <i>add-ons/TrackerAddOns.h</i> - Haiku only contains the latter.</li>

<li>If you have subclassed BString and if you are using its _privateData member, you might notice that it has been renamed to fPrivateData. However, it's use is deprecated, and it might even be made private in the future.</li>

<li>The undocumented functions defined in <storage/Alias.h> are not implemented.</li>

<li>The private Device Map API (used by OpenTracker) has been replaced by a different API (Disk Device API).</li>

<li>The application debugging interface (<kernel/debugger.h>) is conceptually similar, but nevertheless source and binary incompatible.</li>

<li>The file system API has changed; file systems that worked on BeOS will no longer work on Haiku.</li>
</ul>

<p>In several places we also dropped compatibility support for older BeOS versions (PR2, R3, R4), which BeOS R5 still featured.</p>
