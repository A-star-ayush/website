<p>
<a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/">Ranish Partition Manager</a> is what it's name implies, a partition manager. It is menu driven, which in my experience creates a better user experience than other command-line tools such as fdisk. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot CD</a>, UBCD for short, is a collection of a variety of software ranging in use from diagnostics to utilities to boot managers and is completely free as in beer. UBCD is fairly straight-forward and is explained on the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> section of Ultimate Boot CD's website.
</p> 

<p>
In addition to CD booting, UBCD can also be installed to boot from a USB drive. The following directions are for use with Windows, including XP and Vista. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/install-and-boot-ultimate-boot-cd-ubcd-from-a-usb-device/" >originating website</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://files.filefront.com/SP27608exe/;9868201;/fileinfo.html">HP USB format tool</a> and format your stick using a Fat 16 or Fat 32 file system</li>
<li>Download and launch <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/UBCDfix2.exe">UBCDfix2.exe</a>, a UBCD folder is created</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/download.html">UBCD ISO</a>, and move to your UBCD folder</li>
<li>From the UBCD folder, click fixubcd2.bat and follow the instructions on screen</li>
<li>Reboot and set your computer to Boot from the USB device</li>
<li>On next launch, you should be booting Ultimate Boot CD from your USB drive</li>
</ul>

Once UBCD is booted select :
<ul>
<li>Filesystems, </li>
<li>Partition Tools, and then</li>
<li>Ranish Partition Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point, UBCD begin loading Ranish Partition Manage. While the partition manager is being loaded, several screens worth of text and prompts will display. These prompts are self-answering and require no input on your behalf. The last prompt, which displays for 30 seconds can be closed manually.  
</p>

<p>
Finally, you'll see a <a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/part.gif">blue menu-driven screen</a>. This is Ranish Partition Manager. At this point, you are now ready to partition your drive as you wish.
