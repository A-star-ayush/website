<p>This year for Haiku Code Drive, the student selection process has been completely overhauled. Unlike last year, where a public vote was held to select the students, our mentors have determined the combinations of &lt;student&gt;-&lt;project&gt;-&lt;mentor&gt;. Since our requirements for <i>Google Summer of Code</i> were greatly improved upon from last year, our mentors were able to confidently decide which of those combinations have the highest chance of succeeding. </p>
