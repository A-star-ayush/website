Creating a monthly recurring donation subscription is a great way to help out
Haiku, as any amount certainly helps and it frees you from needing to stop by
the donations page each month. Please, <a href='http://www.haiku-inc.org/contact.html'>contact us</a>
if you would like to set up a recurring donation with a different time interval.
For example an automatic yearly or bi-annual subscription.
