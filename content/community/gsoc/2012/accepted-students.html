<h2>Five students to be mentored by Haiku in Google Summer of Code 2012!</h2>
<img src="/files/accepted-students.png" border="8" align="right" />
<p>
For this year's <a href="http://google-melange.com/">Google Summer of Code&trade;</a> program, we at Haiku have been allocated five students!
In 2012, 406 mentoring organizatins applied and 4258 students submitted 6685 proposals. 
<strong>Haiku is proud to be one of the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2012">180 accepted mentoring organizations</a>,
with five accepted students.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Haiku's goals for <em>Google Summer of Code</em> have evolved.
Originally the ability to evaluate the students' capabilities was lacking and the attention was simply on choosing projects that filled a need.
Now, the emphasis is placed on choosing the best students, as they are more important than their short term code contributions.
During the application process, those students instilled a sense of hope and confidence in Haiku's mentors that they will mature into full project contributors.
In other words,<strong> this is our opportunity to grow and refine young, intelligent, and highly motivated
students into people who will continue to develop Haiku in the years to come.</strong>
</p>

<p>
For the past three years, students applying to Haiku were (at first encouraged and later) required to submit a code contribution.
By requiring potential students to submit a code contribution during the application period, Haiku's mentors achieve several things.
First and foremost, it shows that each student possesses basic skills that many of us take for granted -- using a bug tracker and compiling Haiku's sources. 
More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities.
This year a total of <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?keywords=~gsoc2012&patch=1">17 patches</a>
were submitted during the application period. 13 of which were submitted by our top 5 selected students!

<h2>Additional Mentors</h2>
<p>
It is worth noting that Haiku has moved past the "one mentor per student mentality". 
In addition to the primary mentors listed above, the following people are part of a pool of mentors.
<strong>The mentor pool is available to all students, as a supplement to their officially listed mentors.</strong>
This improves the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus Factor</a>,
by enabling other interested and knowledgeable people to participate in the students' daily activities.
