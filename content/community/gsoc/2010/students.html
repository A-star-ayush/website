<p>Qualifying students can apply for one of our Google Summer of Code&trade 2010 project ideas between March 29th and April 9th, 2010.</p>

<h3>Student Application Mini-FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When do I apply?</strong><br />March 29th - April 9th</li>
<li><strong>How much time is left to apply?</strong><br />Countdown: <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=04&day=09&year=2010&hour=19">Student  Application Deadline</a></li>
<li><strong>Where do I apply?</strong><br />Start from the <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">Google Summer of Code 2010 site</a></li>
<li><strong>What ideas can I apply for?</strong><br />You can suggest your own idea(s) or check out our <a href="/community/gsoc/2010/ideas">List of Google Summer of Code Ideas</a></li>
<li><strong>What info do you need in the application?</strong><br />See the <strong>Application Template</strong> below for reference</li>
<li><strong>What if I still have questions?</strong><br />Send a message to the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/haiku">Haiku Mailing List</a> or contact Haiku's <i>Google Summer of Code</i> administrator (<a href="/user/331/contact">Matt Madia</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Are there any other requirements?</strong><br />We are strongly <strong>suggesting students to submit a code contribution</strong> to our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/">bugtracker</a>. This could either be a <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&summary=%7Eeasy">task marked easy</a>, <a href="http://haiku.it.su.se:8180/source/search?q=TODO&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=">TODO commented in code</a>, or any other unlisted task. Submitting code that relates to your project will indicate a higher level of understanding and ability. The number and difficulty of resolved issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is suggested to include the keyword "gsoc2010" on tickets that contain submissions, as this facilitates finding them in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Why do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?</strong><br />
This serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity for you, the student to showcase yourself and to convince us that you are indeed the right person for the job.
