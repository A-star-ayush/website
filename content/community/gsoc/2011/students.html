<p>Qualifying students can apply for one of our <i>Google Summer of Code</i> 2011 project ideas between March 28th and April 8th, 2011.</p>

<h3>Student Application Mini-FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When do I apply?</strong><br />March 28th - April 8th</li>
<li><strong>How much time is left to apply?</strong><br />Countdown: <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=04&day=08&year=2011&hour=19">Student Application Deadline</a></li>
<li><strong>Where do I apply?</strong><br />Start from the <a href="http://google-melange.com/">Google Summer of Code 2011 site</a></li>
<li><strong>What ideas can I apply for?</strong><br />You can suggest your own idea(s) or check out our <a href="/community/gsoc/2011/ideas">List of Google Summer of Code Ideas</a></li>
<li><strong>What info do you need in the application?</strong><br />See the <strong>Application Template</strong> below for reference</li>
<li><strong>What if I still have questions?</strong><br />Send a message to the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/haiku">Haiku Mailing List</a> or contact Haiku's <i>Google Summer of Code</i> administrator (<a href="/user/331/contact">Matt Madia</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Are there any other requirements?</strong><br />We are strongly <strong>suggesting students to submit a code contribution</strong> to our <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/">bugtracker</a>. This could either be a <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&summary=%7Eeasy">task marked easy</a>, <a href="http://haiku.it.su.se:8180/source/search?q=TODO&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=">TODO commented in code</a>, <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">Code style cleanup</a>, or any other unlisted task. Submitting code that relates to your project will indicate a higher level of understanding and ability. The number and difficulty of resolved issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is suggested to <strong>include the keyword "gsoc2011" on tickets</strong> that contain submissions, as this facilitates finding them in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Why do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?</strong><br />
This serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity for you, the student to showcase yourself and to <strong>convince us that you are indeed the right person for the job.</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Should I use Haiku R1/A2 or a newer nightly image?</strong><br />
As R1/A2 was released some time ago, it is preferable to use a newer <a href="http://www.haiku-files.org">nightly image</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making a Positive Impression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit a patch: 
<ul>
<li><strong>that relates to your project</strong></li>
<li>is quality code that conforms to our <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">Coding Guidelines</a></li>
<li>feel free to submit more than one patch!</li>
</ul>
<li>
<li>Have a positive impact on mailing lists, bug tracker, and other public spaces</li>
<li>Do your homework ; Show that you have:
<ul>
<li>researched your project</li>
<li>an understanding of what needs to be done</li>
<li>a proper plan for accomplishing it, which includes quantifiable goals and timelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit an alternate proposal, as this provides our mentors with flexibility for choosing the best students, rather than the best project ideas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Words of Advice</h3>
<p>
Reading and following this advice will do wonders for ensuring 
that your <i>Google Summer of Code</i> experience will be something to be proud of.
</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Communicate frequently</strong><br /> 
  This includes both with your mentor and on the haiku-gsoc mailing list.
  It is important for your mentors to have a clear picture of what you are doing, have done, and plan to do.
  While being self-sufficient is a worthwhile trait, it is not an ideal trait for a Google Summer of Code participant -- Haiku expects you to utilize our mentors, that is why they are there.
</li>

<li><strong>Provide code frequently</strong><br />
  There is a saying in open source -- commit often, commit frequently.
  Take that advice to heart.
  Smaller patches and code snippets are easier for the mentors to review.
  It also gives them more chances to suggest better approaches and keep you on target.
  In turn, this will make you more productive and more likely to succeed!
</li>

<li>
<strong>When you do not have code, it is even more critical to converse frequently.</strong><br />
  If you aren't coding, what are you doing?
  How are you moving closer to your goal?
  What problems are you analyzing?
  What questions and ideas do you have?
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Pass or Fail Criteria</h3>

<p>As you know, <i>Google Summer of Code</i> has two evaluation points -- mid-term (July 15) and final (August 26). 
If you happen to receive a failing mark at either point, you are not paid that portion and your internship comes to an abrupt end.
<strong>Haiku also introduces a 1/4-term and 3/4-term milestones</strong>, to further help you the student with time management. 
While the 1/4-term and 3/4-term are not recognized by Google, your mentor will use those milestones in determining you mid-term and final evaluation. There are two areas that are considered during the evaluation: the code output and communication/interactions.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code.</strong><br />
This includes everything from 'commit worthy' patches to all the code (and non-code, such as design documents or pseudo code) leading up to that polished patch.
In other words, if for some reason you and your mentor pursue an approach that turns out to be a dead end you will not be punished.</li>

<li><strong>Communication.</strong><br />
This includes talking directly with your mentor, 
engaging the haiku-gsoc list to seek a larger audience, 
and posting the Milestone Blog/Email Reports.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In other words,<strong>we expect you to be writing code and talking with one or more mentors on a daily basis.
</strong>Anything less will hurt your mid-term and final evaluation!
Do not expect to be able to cram days, weeks, or months of work into a shorter period and receive a passing evaluation.
